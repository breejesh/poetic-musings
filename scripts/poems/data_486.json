Wash, dress, be brief in praying:   \nFew beads are best when once we go a-Maying.   \n  \nCome, my Corinna, come; and coming, mark   \nHow each field turns a street, each street a park,   \n    Made green and trimm'd with trees! see how   \n    Devotion gives each house a bough   \n    Or branch! each porch, each door, ere this,   \n    An ark, a tabernacle is,   \nMade up of white-thorn neatly interwove,   \nAs if here were those cooler shades of love.   \n    Can such delights be in the street   \n    And open fields, and we not see 't?   \n    Come, we'll abroad: and let 's obey   \n    The proclamation made for May,   \nAnd sin no more, as we have done, by staying;   \nBut, my Corinna, come, let 's go a-Maying.   \n  \nThere 's not a budding boy or girl this day   \nBut is got up and gone to bring in May.   \n    A deal of youth ere this is come   \n    Back, and with white-thorn laden home.   \n    Some have despatch'd their cakes and cream,   \n    Before that we have left to dream:   \nAnd some have wept and woo'd, and plighted troth,   \nAnd chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth:\n    Many a green-gown has been given,   \n    Many a kiss, both odd and even:   \n    Many a glance, too, has been sent   \n    From out the eye, love's firmament:   \nMany a jest told of the keys betraying\nThis night, and locks pick'd: yet we're not a-Maying!   \n  \nCome, let us go, while we are in our prime,   \nAnd take the harmless folly of the time!   \n    We shall grow old apace, and die   \n    Before we know our liberty.\n    Our life is short, and our days run   \n    As fast away as does the sun.   \nAnd, as a vapour or a drop of rain,   \nOnce lost, can ne'er be found again,   \n    So when or you or I are made\n    A fable, song, or fleeting shade,   \n    All love, all liking, all delight   \n    Lies drown'd with us in endless night.   \nThen, while time serves, and we are but decaying,   \nCome, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "View from a Temporary Window", "view_node": "/poem/view-temporary-window", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/joanie-mackowski\" hreflang=\"und\">Joanie Mackowski</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>\n<i>Follow the wrecking ball</i>: in a month, it will smash\ninto this glass\n\nlike that housefly.

Though we remain\nimpressed by your emaciation and your hunger and,\nfrankly, find you photogenic and think your images\nboth alarming and aesthetically pleasing, to do anything\nmore than sigh will require a complex process\nof application and review, a process that is currently\nin the development stage. Meanwhile, may we suggest\nyou moderate your public suffering at least\nuntil the Committee on Appropriate Postures for the Suffering\nis able to produce guidelines. Do not be alarmed.\nThe committee has asked me to assure you\nthat they are sensitive both to the aesthetic qualities\nof your suffering\u2014the blank stares, the neotonous beauty\nas the flesh recedes and the eyes seem to grow larger,\nthe haloes of flies\u2014and to the physical limitations\nof human endurance and the positioning of limbs.\nThey will, I am certain, ask that you not lift\nyour naked children like offerings to the gods.\nOn this topic, discussion has centered around the unfair\nadvantage such ploys give the parents of such children.\nThe childless, whether by choice or fate, are left\nto wither silently in the doorways while those with children\nproffer and gesticulate in the avenues unabated.\nThis offends our cherished sense of fairness,\nthe democratic impulse that informs and energizes\nour discussions. Therefore, we ask for restraint,\nand where restraint is lacking, we will legislate.\nPlease be forewarned. In addition, the committee\nwill recommend that the shouting of slogans,\nwhether directed at governments or deities, be kept\nto a minimum. Not only is such shouting displeasing\naesthetically, but it suggests there is something\nto be done. Believe me, no one is more acutely aware\nof your condition than we who must ignore it everyday\non our way to the capitol. In this matter, we ask only\nthat you become more aware of your fellow citizens,\nwho must juggle iPods, blackberries, briefcases\nand cell phones, lattes. Who must march steadily\nor be trampled by the similarly burdened citizens\nimmediately behind them. Your shouting and pointing\ndoes not serve you well.

Please be aware: To eliminate\nyour poverty, your hunger, your aesthetically\npleasing, yet disturbing, presence in our doorways,\nabove our heating grates, in our subway tunnels\nand under our freeways would mean the elimination\nof the agency itself and quite possibly a decline\nin tourism. Those of us employed by the agency\nhave neither the stamina, persistence, nor the luminous\nskin tones that you present to the viewing public.\nFinally, to those who would recommend programs,\nwho would call for funding and action,\nI must remind you that we have been charged not\nwith <i>eliminating</i> your suffering but with <i>managing</i> it.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Meister Eckhart&#039;s Sermon on Flowers and the Philosopher&#039;s Reply", "view_node": "/poem/meister-eckharts-sermon-flowers-and-philosophers-reply", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/j-michael-martinez\" hreflang=\"und\">J.
