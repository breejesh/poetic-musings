bad that year;\nFuel was scarce,\n   And food was dear.\n \nA wind with a wolf\u2019s head\n   Howled about our door,\nAnd we burned up the chairs\n   And sat upon the floor.\n \nAll that was left us\n   Was a chair we couldn\u2019t break,\nAnd the harp with a woman\u2019s head\n   Nobody would take,\n   For song or pity\u2019s sake.\n \nThe night before Christmas\n   I cried with the cold,\nI cried myself to sleep\n   Like a two-year-old.\n \nAnd in the deep night\n   I felt my mother rise,\nAnd stare down upon me\n   With love in her eyes.\n \nI saw my mother sitting\n   On the one good

Rapidly,\n \nAnd gold threads whistling\n   Through my mother\u2019s hand.\nI saw the web grow,\n   And the pattern expand.\n \nShe wove a child\u2019s jacket,\n   And when it was done\nShe laid it on the floor\n   And wove another one.\n \nShe wove a red cloak\n   So regal to see,\n\u201cShe\u2019s made it for a king\u2019s son,\u201d\n   I said, \u201cand not for me.\u201d\n   But I knew it was for me.\n \nShe wove a pair of breeches\n   Quicker than that!\nShe wove a pair of boots\n   And a little cocked hat.\n \nShe wove a pair of mittens,\n   She wove a little blouse,\nShe wove all night\n   In the still, cold house.\n \nShe sang as she worked,\n   And the harp-strings spoke;\nHer voice never faltered,\n   And the thread never broke.\n   And when I awoke,\u2014\n \nThere sat my mother\n   With the harp against her shoulder\nLooking nineteen\n   And not a day older,\n \nA smile about her lips,\n   And a light about her head,\nAnd her hands in the harp-strings\n   Frozen dead.\n \nAnd piled up beside her\n   And toppling to the skies,\nWere the clothes of a king\u2019s son,\n   Just my size.\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Makebelieve", "view_node": "/poem/makebelieve",
