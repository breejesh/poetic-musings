jovial cheer;\nFor it's just that I should tell you how (of all days in the year)\nThis day of our adversity was blessed Christmas morn,\nAnd the house above the coastguard's was the house where I was born.\n\nO well I saw the pleasant room, the pleasant faces there,\nMy mother's silver spectacles, my father's silver hair;\nAnd well I saw the firelight, like a flight of homely elves,\nGo dancing round the china-plates that stand upon the shelves.\n\nAnd well I knew the talk they had, the talk that was of me,\nOf the shadow on the household and the son that went to sea;\nAnd O the wicked fool I seemed, in every kind of way,\nTo be here and hauling frozen ropes on blessed Christmas Day.\n\nThey lit the high sea-light, and the dark began to fall.\n\"All hands to loose topgallant sails,\" I heard the captain call.\n\"By the Lord, she'll never stand it,\" our first mate Jackson, cried.\n...\"It's the one way or the other, Mr. Jackson,\" he replied.\n\nShe staggered to her bearings, but the sails were new and good,\nAnd the ship smelt up to windward just as though she understood.\nAs the winter's day was ending, in the entry of the night,\nWe cleared the weary headland, and passed below the light.\n\nAnd they heaved a mighty breath, every soul on board but me,\nAs they saw her nose again pointing handsome out to sea;\nBut all that I could think of, in the darkness and the cold,\nWas just that I was leaving home and my folks were growing old.</pre>\n"}, {"title": "A Hymn on the Nativity of My Savior", "view_node": "/poem/hymn-nativity-my-savior", "field_author": "<a

At his back,\nthe harvested acres of bluegrass and timothy\nrippled. I watched from a shallow hill\nas the globe, chained to the flank of his pickup truck,\ngalloped and bucked down a yellow row, arced\nat the fire trench, circled back,\narced again, the flames behind\nsketching first a <i>C</i>, then closing to <i>O</i>\u2014a word\nor wreath, a flapping, slack-based heart,\n\ngradually filling. To me at least. To the mare\nbeside me, my father dragged a gleaming fence,\nsome cinch-corral she might have known,\nthe way the walls moved rhythmically,\nin and in. And to the crows, manic\non the thermals? A crescent of their planet,\n\ngone to sudden sun. I watched one stutter\npast the fence line, then settle\non a Hereford's tufted nape,\nas if to peck some safer grain, as if\nthe red-cast back it rode\ncontained no transformations.\n\n     2.\n\nA seepage, then, from the fire's edge: there\nand there, the russet flood of rabbits.\nOver the sounds of burning, their haunted calls\nbegan, shrill and wavering, as if\ntheir dormant voice strings\nhad tightened into threads of glass.\n\nIn an instant they were gone\u2014the rabbits,\ntheir voices\u2014over the fire trench,\ninto the fallows. My father walked\nnear the burn line, waved up to me, and from\nthat wave, or the rippled film of heat,\n\nI remembered our porch in an August wind,\nhow he stepped through the weathered doorway,\nhis hand outstretched with some\nbook-pressed flower, orchid or lily, withered\nto a parchment brown. <i>Here</i>, he said, but\nas he spoke it atomized before us\u2014\npulp and stem, the pollened tongue,\ndreadful in the dancing air.\n\n     3.\n\nScummed and boxcar thin,\nsix glass-walled houses stretched beside our fields.\nInside them, lilies, lilies\u2014\n\na thousand shades of white, I think.\nEggshell, oyster, parchment, flax.\n\nFar down the black-mulched beds, they seemed\nancestral to me, the fluted heads of\ndowagers, their meaty, groping,\nsilent tongues. They seemed\nto form perspective's chain:\ncinder, bone, divinity . . .\n\n     4.\n\nMy father waved. The crows set down.\nBy evening, our fields took the texture\nof freshened clay, a sleek\nand water-bloated sheen, although no water\nrested there\u2014just heat and ash\nunited in a slick mirage. I crossed the fence line,\ncircled closer, the grasses all around me\ncollapsing into tufts of smoke. Then as I bent\nI saw the shapes, rows and rows of tougher stems\u2014\n\nbrittle, black, metallic wisps, like something grown\nto echo grass. The soot was warm,\nthe sky held smoke in a jaundiced wing,\nand as a breeze crossed slowly through,\nstems glowed\u2014then ebbed\u2014\nconsecutively.
