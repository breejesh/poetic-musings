as many letters</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in my bloodstream as the planet Mercury</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">would allow and so traveled the city</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on buses late afternoons and read all the billboards</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">high above the streets and byways,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on sides of factories and churches and never</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">heard the sermons of the displaced</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or blustery talk of founding fathers, and saddened</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">when a route snaked through long tunnels,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and then eased when reemerged</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">out of the murder of light.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I could feel my veins thicken like the winnings</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of a Powerball, and the mystery of women</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">lounging around a gray-bearded man in a silk</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">smoking jacket drinking a tumbler of cognac</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">was like the easeful glide of a narcotic dream.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My mouth puckered whenever lemon-colored</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">arches appeared five stories above the city</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like golden gates to an unforeseen heaven.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">As a rule, I never glanced at other commuters</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or curators in loosened ties and tuxedos</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">who clutched brown-papered bottles</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and nodded to a stillness as though murdered in a film.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Instead, I glimpsed myself looking out a window,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">awed by Cartier timepieces and luxury cars</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that asked was I hungry for speed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or ordered me to let my body drive.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I ate advertisements like sea waves eating a coastline,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and though my sense of self was as bruised as a

now,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">when I read a newspaper, I flutter like a sparrow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">at a birdfeeder, and when language spills out</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of my skull like a massive cruise ship docked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and towering over a line of ramshackle huts</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on an island whose blessed poor gaze up</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as though a locker of dollars fell at their feet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">my brain closes and my veins burst</span><br
