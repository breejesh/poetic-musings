misty mid region of Weir\u2014\nIt was down by the dank tarn of Auber,\nIn the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\n\nHere once, through an alley Titanic,\nOf cypress, I roamed with my Soul\u2014\nOf cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.\nThese were days when my heart was volcanic\nAs the scoriac rivers that roll\u2014\nAs the lavas that restlessly roll\nTheir sulphurous currents down Yaanek\nIn the ultimate climes of the pole\u2014\nThat groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek\nIn the realms of the boreal pole.\n\nOur talk had been serious and sober,\nBut our thoughts they were palsied and sere\u2014\nOur memories were treacherous and sere,\u2014\nFor we knew not the month was October,\nAnd we marked not the night of the year\n(Ah, night of all nights in the year!)\u2014\nWe noted not the dim lake of Auber\n(Though once we had journeyed down here)\u2014\nRemembered not the dank tarn of Auber,\nNor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.\n\nAnd now, as the night was senescent\nAnd star-dials pointed to morn\u2014\nAs the star-dials hinted of morn\u2014\nAt the end of our path a liquescent\nAnd nebulous lustre was born,\nOut of which a miraculous crescent\nArose with a duplicate horn\u2014\nAstarte's bediamonded crescent\nDistinct with its duplicate horn.\n\nAnd I said: \"She is warmer than Dian;\nShe rolls through an ether of sighs\u2014\nShe revels in a region of sighs:\nShe has seen that the tears are not dry on\nThese cheeks, where the worm never dies,\nAnd has come past the stars of the Lion\nTo point us the path to the skies\u2014\nTo the Lethean peace of the skies\u2014\nCome up, in despite of the Lion,\nTo shine on us with her bright eyes\u2014\nCome up through the lair of the Lion,\nWith love in her luminous eyes.\"\n\nBut Psyche, uplifting her finger,\nSaid: \"Sadly this star I mistrust\u2014\nHer pallor I strangely mistrust:\nAh, hasten! \u2014ah, let us not linger!\nAh, fly! \u2014let us fly! -for we must.\"\nIn terror she spoke, letting sink her\nWings until they trailed in the dust\u2014\nIn agony sobbed, letting sink her\nPlumes till they trailed in the dust\u2014\nTill they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.\n\nI replied: \"This is nothing but dreaming:\nLet us on by this tremulous light!\nLet us bathe in this crystalline light!\nIts Sybilic splendour is beaming\nWith Hope and in Beauty tonight!\u2014\nSee!\u2014it flickers up the sky through the night!\nAh, we safely may trust to its gleaming,\nAnd be sure it will lead us aright\u2014\nWe safely may trust to a gleaming,\nThat cannot but guide us aright,\nSince it flickers up to Heaven through the night.\"\n\nThus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,\nAnd tempted her out of her gloom\u2014\nAnd conquered her scruples and gloom;\nAnd we passed to the end of the vista,\nBut were stopped by the door of a tomb\u2014\nBy the door of a legended tomb;\nAnd I said: \"What is written, sweet sister,\nOn the door of this legended tomb?\"\nShe replied: \"Ulalume

cried: \"It was surely October\nOn this very night of last year\nThat I journeyed\u2014I journeyed down here!\u2014\nThat I brought a dread burden down here\u2014\nOn this night of all nights in the

vestal's veins?\nWhy rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?\nWhy feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?\nYet, yet I love! \u2014 From Abelard it came,\nAnd Eloisa yet must kiss the name.\n\nDear fatal name! rest ever unreveal'd,\nNor pass these lips in holy silence seal'd.\nHide it, my heart, within that close disguise,\nWhere mix'd with God's, his lov'd idea lies:\nO write it not, my hand \u2014 the name appears\nAlready written \u2014 wash it out, my tears!\nIn vain lost Eloisa weeps and prays,\nHer heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.\n\nRelentless walls! whose darksome round contains\nRepentant sighs, and voluntary pains:\nYe rugged rocks! which holy knees have worn;\nYe grots and caverns shagg'd with horrid thorn!\nShrines! where their vigils pale-ey'd virgins keep,\nAnd pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep!\nThough cold like you, unmov'd, and silent grown,\nI have not yet forgot myself to stone.\nAll is not Heav'n's while Abelard has part,\nStill rebel nature holds out half my heart;\nNor pray'rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,\nNor tears, for ages, taught to flow in vain.\n\nSoon as thy letters trembling I unclose,\nThat well-known name awakens all my woes.\nOh name for ever sad! for ever dear!\nStill breath'd in sighs, still usher'd with a tear.\nI tremble too, where'er my own I find,\nSome dire misfortune follows close behind.\nLine after line my gushing eyes o'erflow,\nLed through a sad variety of woe:\nNow warm in love, now with'ring in thy bloom,\nLost in a convent's solitary gloom!\nThere stern religion quench'd th' unwilling flame,\nThere died the best of passions, love and fame.\n\nYet write, oh write me all, that I may join\nGriefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.\nNor foes nor fortune take this pow'r away;\nAnd is my Abelard less kind than they?\nTears still are mine, and those I need not spare,\nLove but demands what else were shed in pray'r;\nNo happier task these faded eyes pursue;\nTo read and weep is all they now can do.\n\nThen share thy pain, allow that sad relief;\nAh, more than share it! give me all thy grief.\nHeav'n first taught letters for some wretch's aid,\nSome banish'd lover, or some captive maid;\nThey live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires,\nWarm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,\nThe virgin's wish without her fears impart,\nExcuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,\nSpeed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,\nAnd waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.\n\nThou know'st how guiltless first I met thy flame,\nWhen Love approach'd me under Friendship's name;\nMy fancy form'd thee of angelic kind,\nSome emanation of th' all-beauteous Mind.\nThose smiling eyes, attemp'ring ev'ry day,\nShone sweetly lambent with celestial day.\nGuiltless I gaz'd; heav'n listen'd while you sung;\nAnd truths divine came mended from that tongue.\nFrom lips like those what precept fail'd to move?\nToo soon they taught me 'twas no sin to love.\nBack through the paths of pleasing sense I ran,\nNor wish'd an Angel whom I lov'd a Man.\nDim and remote the joys of saints I see;\nNor envy them, that heav'n I lose for thee.\n\nHow oft, when press'd to marriage, have I said,\nCurse on all laws but those which love has made!\nLove, free as air, at sight of human ties,\nSpreads his light wings, and in a moment flies,\nLet wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,\nAugust her deed, and sacred be her fame;\nBefore true passion all those views remove,\nFame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?\nThe jealous God, when we profane his fires,\nThose restless passions in revenge inspires;\nAnd bids them make mistaken mortals groan,\nWho seek in love for aught but love alone.\nShould at my feet the world's great master fall,\nHimself, his throne, his world, I'd scorn 'em all:\nNot Caesar's empress would I deign to prove;\nNo, make me mistress to the man I love;\nIf there be yet another name more free,\nMore fond than mistress, make me that to thee!\nOh happy state! when souls each other draw,\nWhen love is liberty, and nature, law:\nAll then is full, possessing, and possess'd,\nNo craving void left aching in the breast:\nEv'n thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,\nAnd each warm wish springs mutual from the heart.\nThis sure is bliss (if bliss on earth there be)\nAnd once the lot of Abelard and me.\n\nAlas, how chang'd! what sudden horrors rise!\nA naked lover bound and bleeding lies!\nWhere, where was Eloise? her voice, her hand,\nHer poniard, had oppos'd the dire command.\nBarbarian, stay! that bloody stroke restrain;\nThe crime was common, common be the pain.\nI can no more; by shame, by rage suppress'd,\nLet tears, and burning blushes speak the rest.\n\nCanst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,\nWhen victims at yon altar's foot we lay?\nCanst thou forget what tears that moment fell,\nWhen, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?\nAs with cold lips I kiss'd the sacred veil,\nThe shrines all trembl'd, and the lamps grew pale:\nHeav'n scarce believ'd the conquest it survey'd,\nAnd saints with wonder heard the vows I made.\nYet then, to those dread altars as I drew,\nNot on the Cross my eyes were fix'd, but you:\nNot grace, or zeal, love only was my call,\nAnd if I lose thy love, I lose my all.\nCome! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe;\nThose still at least are left thee to bestow.\nStill on that breast enamour'd let me lie,\nStill drink delicious poison from thy eye,\nPant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press'd;\nGive all thou canst \u2014 and let me dream the rest.\nAh no! instruct me other joys to prize,\nWith other beauties charm my partial eyes,\nFull in my view set all the bright abode,\nAnd make my soul quit Abelard for God.\n\nAh, think at least thy flock deserves thy care,\nPlants of thy hand, and children of thy pray'r.\nFrom the false world in early youth they fled,\nBy thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.\nYou rais'd these hallow'd walls; the desert smil'd,\nAnd Paradise was open'd in the wild.\nNo weeping orphan saw his father's stores\nOur shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;\nNo silver saints, by dying misers giv'n,\nHere brib'd the rage of ill-requited heav'n:\nBut such plain roofs as piety could raise,\nAnd only vocal with the Maker's praise.\nIn these lone walls (their days eternal bound)\nThese moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown'd,\nWhere awful arches make a noonday night,\nAnd the dim windows shed a solemn light;\nThy eyes diffus'd a reconciling ray,\nAnd gleams of glory brighten'd all the day.\nBut now no face divine contentment wears,\n'Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.\nSee how the force of others' pray'rs I try,\n(O pious fraud of am'rous charity!)\nBut why should I on others' pray'rs depend?\nCome thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!\nAh let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move,\nAnd all those tender names in one, thy love!\nThe darksome pines that o'er yon rocks reclin'd\nWave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,\nThe wand'ring streams that shine between the hills,\nThe grots that echo to the tinkling rills,\nThe dying gales that pant upon the trees,\nThe lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;\nNo more these scenes my meditation aid,\nOr lull to rest the visionary maid.\nBut o'er the twilight groves and dusky caves,\nLong-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,\nBlack Melancholy sits, and round her throws\nA death-like silence, and a dread repose:\nHer gloomy presence saddens all the scene,\nShades ev'ry flow'r, and darkens ev'ry green,\nDeepens the murmur of the falling floods,\nAnd breathes a browner horror on the woods.\n\nYet here for ever, ever must I stay;\nSad proof how well a lover can obey!\nDeath, only death, can break the lasting chain;\nAnd here, ev'n then, shall my cold dust remain,\nHere all its frailties, all its flames resign,\nAnd wait till 'tis no sin to mix with thine.\n\nAh wretch! believ'd the spouse of God in vain,\nConfess'd within the slave of love and man.\nAssist me, Heav'n! but whence arose that pray'r?\nSprung it from piety, or from despair?\nEv'n here, where frozen chastity retires,\nLove finds an altar for forbidden fires.\nI ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;\nI mourn the lover, not lament the fault;\nI view my crime, but kindle at the view,\nRepent old pleasures, and solicit new;\nNow turn'd to Heav'n, I weep my past offence,\nNow think of thee, and curse my innocence.\nOf all affliction taught a lover yet,\n'Tis sure the hardest science to forget!\nHow shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense,\nAnd love th' offender, yet detest th' offence?\nHow the dear object from the crime remove,\nOr how distinguish penitence from love?\nUnequal task! a passion to resign,\nFor hearts so touch'd, so pierc'd, so lost as mine.\nEre such a soul regains its peaceful state,\nHow often must it love, how often hate!\nHow often hope, despair, resent, regret,\nConceal, disdain \u2014 do all things but forget.\nBut let Heav'n seize it, all at once 'tis fir'd;\nNot touch'd, but rapt; not waken'd, but inspir'd!\nOh come! oh teach me nature to subdue,\nRenounce my love, my life, myself \u2014 and you.\nFill my fond heart with God alone, for he\nAlone can rival, can succeed to thee.\n\nHow happy is the blameless vestal's lot!\nThe world forgetting, by the world forgot.\nEternal sunshine of the spotless mind!\nEach pray'r accepted, and each wish resign'd;\nLabour and rest, that equal periods keep;\n\"Obedient slumbers that can wake and weep;\"\nDesires compos'd, affections ever ev'n,\nTears that delight, and sighs that waft to Heav'n.\nGrace shines around her with serenest beams,\nAnd whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams.\nFor her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms,\nAnd wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes,\nFor her the Spouse prepares the bridal ring,\nFor her white virgins hymeneals sing,\nTo sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away,\nAnd melts in visions of eternal day.\n\nFar other dreams my erring soul employ,\nFar other raptures, of unholy joy:\nWhen at the close of each sad, sorrowing day,\nFancy restores what vengeance snatch'd away,\nThen conscience sleeps, and leaving nature free,\nAll my loose soul unbounded springs to thee.\nOh curs'd, dear horrors of all-conscious night!\nHow glowing guilt exalts the keen delight!\nProvoking Daemons all restraint remove,\nAnd stir within me every source of love.\nI hear thee, view thee, gaze o'er all thy charms,\nAnd round thy phantom glue my clasping arms.\nI wake \u2014 no more I hear, no more I view,\nThe phantom flies me, as unkind as you.\nI call aloud; it hears not what I say;\nI stretch my empty arms; it glides away.\nTo dream once more I close my willing eyes;\nYe soft illusions, dear deceits, arise!\nAlas, no more \u2014 methinks we wand'ring go\nThrough dreary wastes, and weep each other's woe,\nWhere round some mould'ring tower pale ivy creeps,\nAnd low-brow'd rocks hang nodding o'er the deeps.\nSudden you mount, you beckon from the skies;\nClouds interpose, waves roar, and winds arise.\nI shriek, start up, the same sad prospect find,\nAnd wake to all the griefs I left behind.\n\nFor thee the fates, severely kind, ordain\nA cool suspense from pleasure and from pain;\nThy life a long, dead calm of fix'd repose;\nNo pulse that riots, and no blood that glows.\nStill as the sea, ere winds were taught to blow,\nOr moving spirit bade the waters flow;\nSoft as the slumbers of a saint forgiv'n,\nAnd mild as opening gleams of promis'd heav'n.\n\nCome, Abelard! for what hast thou to dread?\nThe torch of Venus burns not for the dead.\nNature stands check'd; Religion disapproves;\nEv'n thou art cold \u2014 yet Eloisa loves.\nAh hopeless, lasting flames! like those that burn\nTo light the dead, and warm th' unfruitful urn.\n\nWhat scenes appear where'er I turn my view?\nThe dear ideas, where I fly, pursue,\nRise in the grove, before the altar rise,\nStain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes.\nI waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee,\nThy image steals between my God and me,\nThy voice I seem in ev'ry hymn to hear,\nWith ev'ry bead I drop too soft a tear.\nWhen from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,\nAnd swelling organs lift the rising soul,\nOne thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,\nPriests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:\nIn seas of flame my plunging soul is drown'd,\nWhile altars blaze, and angels tremble round.\n\nWhile prostrate here in humble grief I lie,\nKind, virtuous drops just gath'ring in my eye,\nWhile praying, trembling, in the dust I roll,\nAnd dawning grace is op'ning on my soul:\nCome, if thou dar'st, all charming as thou art!\nOppose thyself to Heav'n; dispute my heart;\nCome, with one glance of those deluding eyes\nBlot out each bright idea of the skies;\nTake back that grace, those sorrows, and those tears;\nTake back my fruitless penitence and pray'rs;\nSnatch me, just mounting, from the blest abode;\nAssist the fiends, and tear me from my God!\n\nNo, fly me, fly me, far as pole from pole;\nRise Alps between us! and whole oceans roll!\nAh, come not, write not, think not once of me,\nNor share one pang of all I felt for thee.\nThy oaths I quit, thy memory resign;\nForget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.\nFair eyes, and tempting looks (which yet I view!)\nLong lov'd, ador'd ideas, all adieu!\nOh Grace serene! oh virtue heav'nly fair!\nDivine oblivion of low-thoughted care!\nFresh blooming hope, gay daughter of the sky!\nAnd faith, our early immortality!\nEnter, each mild, each amicable guest;\nReceive, and wrap me in eternal rest!\n\nSee in her cell sad Eloisa spread,\nPropp'd on some tomb, a neighbour of the dead.\nIn each low wind methinks a spirit calls,\nAnd more than echoes talk along the walls.\nHere, as I watch'd the dying lamps around,\nFrom yonder shrine I heard a hollow sound.\n\"Come, sister, come!\" (it said, or seem'd to say)\n\"Thy place is here, sad sister, come away!\nOnce like thyself, I trembled, wept, and pray'd,\nLove's victim then, though now a sainted maid:\nBut all is calm in this eternal sleep;\nHere grief forgets to groan, and love to weep,\nEv'n superstition loses ev'ry fear:\nFor God, not man, absolves our frailties here.\"\n\nI come, I come! prepare your roseate bow'rs,\nCelestial palms, and ever-blooming flow'rs.\nThither, where sinners may have rest, I go,\nWhere flames refin'd in breasts seraphic glow:\nThou, Abelard! the last sad office pay,\nAnd smooth my passage to the realms of day;\nSee my lips tremble, and my eye-balls roll,\nSuck my last breath, and catch my flying soul!\nAh no \u2014 in sacred vestments may'st thou stand,\nThe hallow'd taper trembling in thy hand,\nPresent the cross before my lifted eye,\nTeach me at once, and learn of me to die.\nAh then, thy once-lov'd Eloisa see!\nIt will be then no crime to gaze on me.\nSee from my cheek the transient roses fly!\nSee the last sparkle languish in my eye!\nTill ev'ry motion, pulse, and breath be o'er;\nAnd ev'n my Abelard be lov'd no more.\nO Death all-eloquent! you only prove\nWhat dust we dote on, when 'tis man we love.\n\nThen too, when fate shall thy fair frame destroy,\n(That cause of all my guilt, and all my joy)\nIn trance ecstatic may thy pangs be drown'd,\nBright clouds descend, and angels watch thee round,\nFrom op'ning skies may streaming glories shine,\nAnd saints embrace thee with a love like mine.\n\nMay one kind grave unite each hapless name,\nAnd graft my love immortal on thy fame!\nThen, ages hence, when all my woes are o'er,\nWhen this rebellious heart shall beat no more;\nIf ever chance two wand'ring lovers brings\nTo Paraclete's white walls and silver springs,\nO'er the pale marble shall they join their heads,\nAnd drink the falling tears each other sheds;\nThen sadly say, with mutual pity mov'd,\n\"Oh may we never love as these have lov'd!\"\n\nFrom the full choir when loud Hosannas rise,\nAnd swell the pomp of dreadful sacrifice,\nAmid that scene if some relenting eye\nGlance on the stone where our cold relics lie,\nDevotion's self shall steal a thought from Heav'n,\nOne human tear shall drop and be forgiv'n.\nAnd sure, if fate some future bard shall join\nIn sad similitude of griefs to mine,\nCondemn'd whole years in absence to deplore,\nAnd image charms he must behold no more;\nSuch if there be, who loves so long, so well;\nLet him our sad, our tender story tell;\nThe well-sung woes will soothe my pensive ghost;\nHe best can paint 'em, who shall feel 'em most.\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "We never know how high we are (1176)", "view_node": "/poem/we-never-know-how-high-we-are-1176", "field_author":

from yonder ivy-mantled tower  \n  The moping owl does to the moon complain            \nOf such as, wandering near her secret bower,  \n  Molest her ancient solitary reign.  \n  \nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade  \n  Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,  \nEach in his narrow cell for ever laid,            \n  The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.  \n  \nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,  \n  The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,  \nThe cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,  \n  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.            \n  \nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn  \n  Or busy housewife ply her evening care:  \nNo children run to lisp their sire's return,  \n  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.  \n  \nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,            \n  Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;  \nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!  \n  How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!  \n  \nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,  \n  Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;            \nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile  \n  The short and simple annals of the Poor.  \n  \nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,  \n  And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave  \nAwaits alike th' inevitable hour:\u2014            \n  The paths of glory lead but to the grave.  \n  \nNor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault  \n  If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,  \nWhere through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault  \n  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.            \n  \nCan storied urn or animated bust  \n  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath,  \nCan Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,  \n  Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?  \n  \nPerhaps in this neglected spot is laid            \n  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;  \nHands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,  \n  Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:  \n  \nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,  \n  Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;            \nChill Penury repress'd their noble rage,  \n  And froze the genial current of the soul.  \n  \nFull many a gem of purest ray serene  \n  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:  \nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,            \n  And waste its sweetness on the desert air.  \n  \nSome village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast  \n  The little tyrant of his fields withstood,  \nSome mute inglorious Milton here may rest,  \n  Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.            \n  \nTh' applause of listening senates to command,  \n  The threats of pain and ruin to despise,  \nTo scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,  \n  And read their history in a nation's eyes  \n  \nTheir lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone            \n  Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;  \nForbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,  \n  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind;  \n  \nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,  \n  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,            \nOr heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride  \n  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.  \n  \nFar from the madding crowd's ignoble strife  \n  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;  \nAlong the cool sequester'd vale of life            \n  They kept the noiseless tenour of their way.  \n  \nYet e'en these bones from insult to protect  \n  Some frail memorial still erected nigh,  \nWith uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,  \n  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.            \n  \nTheir name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,  \n  The place of fame and elegy supply:  \nAnd many a holy text around she strews,  \n  That teach the rustic moralist to die.  \n  \nFor who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,            \n  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,  \nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,  \n  Nor cast one longing lingering look behind?  \n  \nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,  \n  Some pious drops the closing eye requires;            \nE'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,  \n  E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.  \n  \nFor thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,  \n  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;  \nIf chance, by lonely Contemplation led,            \n  Some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate,\u2014 \n  \nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,  \n  'Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn  \nBrushing with hasty steps the dews away,  \n  To meet the sun upon the upland lawn;             \n  \n'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech  \n  That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,  \nHis listless length at noon-tide would he stretch,  \n  And pore upon the brook that babbles by.  \n  \n'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,             \n  Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;  \nNow drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,  \n  Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.  \n  \n'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,  \n  Along the heath, and near his favourite tree;             \nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,  \n  Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;  \n  \n'The next with dirges due in sad array  \n  Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne,\u2014\nApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay             \n  Graved on the stone beneath yon ag\u00e8d thorn:'  \n  \n<i>The Epitaph\n\nHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth  \n  A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown;  \nFair Science frown'd not on his humble birth  \n  And Melancholy mark'd him for her own.             \n  \nLarge was his bounty, and his soul sincere;  \n  Heaven did a recompense as largely send:  \nHe gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,  \n  He gain'd from Heaven, 'twas all he wish'd, a friend.  \n  \nNo farther seek his merits to disclose,             \n  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode,  \n(There they alike in trembling hope repose,)  \n  The bosom of his Father and his God.</i></pre>\n "}, {"title": "Silence", "view_node":

His youth was fully blown, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, for those simple times, his garments were </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was hung a silver bugle, and between </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To common lookers on, like one who dream'd </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of idleness in groves Elysian: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But there were some who feelingly could scan </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A lurking trouble in his nether lip, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And see that oftentimes the reins would slip </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of logs piled solemnly.\u2014Ah, well-a-day, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Why should our young Endymion pine away! </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To sudden veneration: women meek </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Endymion too, without a forest peer, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Among his brothers of the mountain chase. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In midst of all, the venerable priest </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, after lifting up his aged hands, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus spake he: \"Men of Latmos! shepherd bands! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whether descended from beneath the rocks </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That overtop your mountains; whether come </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From vallies where the pipe is never dumb; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And all ye gentle girls who foster up </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Udderless lambs, and in a little cup </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Will put choice honey for a favoured youth: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yea, every one attend! for in good truth </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Night-swollen mushrooms?

Thus all out-told </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their fond imaginations,\u2014saving him </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Endymion: yet hourly had he striven </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To hide the cankering venom, that had riven </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His fainting recollections. Now indeed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sudden silence, or the whispers low, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But in the self-same fixed trance he kept, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like one who on the earth had never stept. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Frozen in that old tale Arabian. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Who whispers him so pantingly and close? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Peona, his sweet sister: of all those, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A yielding up, a cradling on her care. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her eloquence did breathe away the curse: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of happy changes in emphatic dreams, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Along a path between two little streams,\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Until they came to where these streamlets fall, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With crystal mocking of the trees and sky. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A little shallop, floating there hard by, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pointed its beak over the fringed bank; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Peona guiding, through the water straight, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Towards a bowery island opposite; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which gaining presently, she steered light </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where nested was an arbour, overwove </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By many a summer's silent fingering; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To whose cool bosom she was used to bring </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her playmates, with their needle broidery, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And minstrel memories of times gone by. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So she was gently glad to see him laid </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Under her favourite bower's quiet shade, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On her own couch, new made of flower leaves, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When last the sun his autumn tresses shook, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Peona's busy hand against his lips, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A patient watch over the stream that creeps </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Windingly by it, so the quiet maid </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Among seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0O magic sleep! O comfortable bird, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of silvery enchantment!\u2014who, upfurl'd </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But renovates and lives?\u2014Thus, in the bower, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Endymion was calm'd to life again. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He said: \"I feel this thine endearing love </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All through my bosom: thou art as a dove </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">About me; and the pearliest dew not brings </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such morning incense from the fields of May, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From those kind eyes,\u2014the very home and haunt </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of sisterly affection. Can I want </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That, any longer, I will pass my days </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, when the pleasant sun is getting low, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Again I'll linger in a sloping mead </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My soul to keep in its resolved course.\" </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hereat Peona, in their silver source, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And took a lute, from which there pulsing came </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A lively prelude, fashioning the way </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">More subtle cadenced, more forest wild </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And nothing since has floated in the air </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The quick invisible strings, even though she saw </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Before the deep intoxication. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her self-possession\u2014swung the lute aside, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And earnestly said: \"Brother, 'tis vain to hide </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That thou dost know of things mysterious, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Immortal, starry; such alone could thus </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Offensive to the heavenly powers?

Rightly have they done: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I, who still saw the horizontal sun </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My spear aloft, as signal for the chace\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I, who, for very sport of heart, would race </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With my own steed from Araby; pluck down </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A vulture from his towery perching; frown </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A lion into growling, loth retire\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"This river does not see the naked sky, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till it begins to progress silverly </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Around the western border of the wood, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seems at the distance like a crescent moon: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in that nook, the very pride of June, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Had I been used to pass my weary eves; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The rather for the sun unwilling leaves </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So dear a picture of his sovereign power, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I could witness his most kingly hour, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he doth lighten up the golden reins, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And paces leisurely down amber plains </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His snorting four. Now when his chariot last </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At which I wondered greatly, knowing well </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That but one night had wrought this flowery spell; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, sitting down close by, began to muse </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In passing here, his owlet pinions shook; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Until my head was dizzy and distraught. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And shaping visions all about my sight </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The which became more strange, and strange, and dim, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The enchantment that afterwards befel? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That never tongue, although it overteem </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Could figure out and to conception bring </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Watching the zenith, where the milky way </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Among the stars in virgin splendour pours; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And travelling my eye, until the doors </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I became loth and fearful to alight </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From such high soaring by a downward glance: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So kept me stedfast in that airy trance, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Spreading imaginary pinions wide. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When, presently, the stars began to glide, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And faint away, before my eager view: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So passionately bright, my dazzled soul </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Commingling with her argent spheres did roll </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through clear and cloudy, even when she went </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At last into a dark and vapoury tent\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of planets all were in the blue again. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By a bright something, sailing down apace, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Making me quickly veil my eyes and face: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Again I look'd, and, O ye deities, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who from Olympus watch our destinies! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whence that completed form of all completeness? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not\u2014thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such follying before thee\u2014yet she had, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And they were simply gordian'd up and braided, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The which were blended in, I know not how, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With such a paradise of lips and eyes, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And plays about its fancy, till the stings </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of human neighbourhood envenom all. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unto what awful power shall I call? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To what high fane?\u2014Ah! see her hovering feet, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From out her cradle shell.

I ev'n dar'd to press </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her very cheek against my crowned lip, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, at that moment, felt my body dip </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into a warmer air: a moment more, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A scent of violets, and blossoming limes, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Made delicate from all white-flower bells; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And once, above the edges of our nest, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">An arch face peep'd,\u2014an Oread as I guess'd. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In midst of all this heaven?

Time, that aged nurse, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">These things, with all their comfortings, are given </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To my down-sunken hours, and with thee, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of weary life.\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thus ended he, and both </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sat silent: for the maid was very loth </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To answer; feeling well that breathed words </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of grasshoppers against the sun.

Hiawatha!\"            \n  And the desolate Hiawatha,  \nFar away amid the forest,  \nMiles away among the mountains,  \nHeard that sudden cry of anguish,  \nHeard the voice of Minnehaha            \nCalling to him in the darkness,  \n\"Hiawatha! Hiawatha!\"  \n  Over snow-fields waste and pathless,  \nUnder snow-encumbered branches,  \nHomeward hurried Hiawatha,            \nEmpty-handed, heavy-hearted,  \nHeard Nokomis moaning, wailing:  \n\"Wahonowin! Wahonowin!  \nWould that I had perished for you,  \nWould that I were dead as you are!            \nWahonowin! Wahonowin!\"  \n  And he rushed into the wigwam,  \nSaw the old Nokomis slowly  \nRocking to and fro and moaning,  \nSaw his lovely Minnehaha            \nLying dead and cold before him,  \nAnd his bursting heart within him  \nUttered such a cry of anguish,  \nThat the forest moaned and shuddered,  \nThat the very stars in heaven            \nShook and trembled with his anguish  \n  Then he sat down, still and speechless,  \nOn the bed of Minnehaha,  \nAt the feet of Laughing Water,  \nAt those willing feet, that never            \nMore would lightly run to meet him,  \nNever more would lightly follow.  \n  With both hands his face he covered,  \nSeven long days and nights he sat there,  \nAs if in a swoon he sat there,            \nSpeechless, motionless, unconscious  \nOf the daylight or the darkness.  \n  Then they buried Minnehaha;  \nIn the snow a grave they made her,  \nIn the forest deep and darksome,            \nUnderneath the moaning hemlocks;  \nClothed her in her richest garments,  \nWrapped her in her robes of ermine,  \nCovered her with snow, like ermine;  \nThus they buried Minnehaha.            \n  And at night a fire was lighted,  \nOn her grave four times was kindled,  \nFor her soul upon its journey  \nTo the Islands of the Blessed.  \nFrom his doorway Hiawatha            \nSaw it burning in the forest,  \nLighting up the gloomy hemlocks;  \nFrom his sleepless bed uprising,  \nFrom the bed of Minnehaha,  \nStood and watched it at the doorway,            \nThat it might not be extinguished,  \nMight not leave her in the darkness.  \n  \"Farewell!\" said he, \"Minnehaha!  \nFarewell, O my Laughing Water!  \nAll my heart is buried with you,            \nAll my thoughts go onward with you!  \nCome not back again to labor,  \nCome not back again to suffer,  \nWhere the Famine and the Fever  \nWear the heart and waste the body.             \nSoon my task will be completed,  \nSoon your footsteps I shall follow  \nTo the Islands of

part  \n\u00a0\u00a0Are longings wild and vain.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the voice of that fitful song            \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sings on, and is never still:  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A boy's will is the wind's will,  \nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'  \n  \nThere are things of which I may not speak;  \n\u00a0\u00a0There are dreams that cannot die;            \nThere are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,  \nAnd bring a pallor into the cheek,  \n\u00a0\u00a0And a mist before the eye.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the words of that fatal song  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Come over me like a chill:            \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A boy's will is the wind's will,  \nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'  \n  \nStrange to me now are the forms I meet  \n\u00a0\u00a0When I visit the dear old town;  \nBut the native air is pure and sweet,            \nAnd the trees that o'ershadow each well-known street,  \n\u00a0\u00a0As they balance up and down,  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are singing the beautiful song,  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are sighing and whispering still:  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A boy's will is the wind's will,            \nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'  \n  \nAnd Deering's Woods are fresh and fair,  \n\u00a0\u00a0And with joy that is almost pain  \nMy heart goes back to wander there,  \nAnd among the dreams of the days that were,            \n\u00a0\u00a0I find my lost youth again.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the strange and beautiful song,  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The groves are repeating it still:  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0'A boy's will is the wind's will,  \nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.'</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Present Crisis", "view_node": "/poem/present-crisis", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/james-russell-lowell\" hreflang=\"und\">James Russell Lowell</a>",
