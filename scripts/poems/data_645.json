And here the rocks\nare under fog, the cedars a temple,\nSedona carved by the wind into gods\u2014\n\neach shadow their worshiper. The siren\nempties Santiago; he watches\n\u2014from a hush of windows\u2014blindfolded men\nblurred in gleaming vans. The horse vanishes\n\ninto a dream. I'm passing skeletal\nfigures carved in 700 B.C.\nWhoever deciphers these canyon walls\nremains forsaken, alone with history,\n\nno harbor for his dream. And what else will\nthis mirror now reason, filled with water?\nI see Peru without rain, Brazil\nwithout forests\u2014and here in Utah a dagger\n\nof sunlight: it's splitting\u2014it's the summer\nsolstice\u2014the quartz center of a spiral.\nDid the Anasazi know the darker \nanswer also\u2014given now in crystal\n\nby the mirrored continent? The solstice,\nbut of winter? A beam stabs the window,\ndiamonds him, a funeral in his eyes.\nIn the lit stadium of Santiago,\n\nthis is the shortest day. He's taken there.\nThose about to die are looking at him, \nhis eyes the ledger of the disappeared.\nWhat will the mirror try now? I'm driving,\n\nstill north, always followed by that country,\nits floors ice, its citizens so lovesick\nthat the ground\u2014sheer glass\u2014of every city\nis torn up. They demand the republic\n\ngive back, jeweled, their every reflection.\nThey dig till dawn but find only corpses.\nHe has returned to this dream for his bones. \nThe waters darken.
