class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The roundness of the ovals suggests a kind of plenty\u2014a trove that the line wraps around protectively like a mother\u2019s arm or like an electrified fence.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">A circle is similarly bounded, but the radial symmetry of the circle suggests safety, stasis.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The oval, instead, is restless, pushing against its boundaries, seeking escape or release.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The line is necessary to contain the oval or to defend it.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The ovals of the figure evoke the pads of a prickly pear, tapering where they join together.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The prickly pear defends its precious hoard of water with its long straight spines.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The figure has no spines.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Instead of spines, the figure has sharp straight lines that make up its arms, legs, eyebrows.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The figure uses these lines to convey hostility\u2014kicking, throwing things, expressing scorn or rage.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">We understand these violent actions to be defensive, motivated by fear\u2014a belief that the cherished contents of the ovals are somehow under threat.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">But the ovals of the figure contain nothing.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Nothing, that is, except the underlying blankness of the page.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The lines of the figure separate the blankness inside the ovals from the blankness outside the ovals.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">We are told to read the figure as white.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">In order to read the figure as white we must read the blank background as white.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">We have often been told that blankness means whiteness.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">But this does not help us understand what it is that the figure fears.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">2.</span></p>\n\n<p><span

lines.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">These lines are known as \u201chatching\u201d or \u201chatchmarks.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">We are

class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The figure has a white face.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">I say \u201cwhite face\u201d although the face is blank because we are told to read these blank spaces as white.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The mouth and eyes are rendered as lines.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Were the hatching lines to cover the face, the expression of the eyes and mouth would no longer be legible.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">In order for the expression to be legible, the face must remain white.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The hatching lines are pulled tightly back from the forehead like the wig of a founding father.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The exposed forehead, arching over each wide eye, suggests the possibility of enlightenment. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Enlightenment is rendered as a form of blankness, the unhatched space.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">In order to achieve enlightenment, the hatching lines must be kept at bay like saplings rooted out to clear a field.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The hatching lines are \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">That is, the hatching lines are beyond the boundary line that separates what is clear from what is not clear. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">We are told that the larger figure is also \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">We are told that the larger figure is drawn to the smaller figure.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">We are told that the smaller figure is not drawn to the larger figure.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The smaller figure keeps the larger figure at bay.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">If the figures were to encroach upon each other, the blank spaces would fill in with hatching lines.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">These spaces would read as black spaces</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">You would not be able to read the lines of arms or legs or features

Or more honestly (it takes even more years), you begin to realize that\u2014perhaps\u2014they are not all <em>supposed</em> to be dead. Or. You still remember. You can still feel yourself there. Standing. Knee-deep. In cement. A particular square on the sidewalk. There were dandelions. That odd, eternal sun. When a dear friend, your sister\u2019s best-best friend\u2014drives by\u2014stops her car in the middle of the street. And then tells you. Screams out of her car window. And says it: your first beloved\u2014that boy for whom you were slowly unfolding yourself from inside outward\u2014that boy, whom you had yet to kiss, but would one day soon kiss certainly\u2014that monumental boy, who smiled at you differently\u2014that boy\u2014had just been shot and killed. By strangers. Just for fun.<br /><br />You are fourteen. And it is the beginning\u2014it is the very first day\u2014when the World confirms that new gleam of suspicion layered on the surface of the dark violet lake inside, that, Yes, slaughter is normal.<br /><br />Slowly, over the years, you train yourself not to want this\u2014<em>you</em>\u2014a body in your bed with whom you can have a real conversation\u2014a body with whom you can walk anywhere, talk anywhere, hear anywhere. At some point, you gave up expecting to be understood. English was too many red languages at once. And History was just a very small one\u2014a ledger, and always in the black. You took out your sheerest sword. Your tongue: a sheath of arrows.<br /><br />Perhaps, not by coincidence\u2014once you began to trip around fifty\u2019s maypole\u2014you and your sister find together the courage to do the math: of all the boys whom you had known as children, at least eighty-percent were all either missing, in jail, or dead. Blood on the streets, bullets in the walls, the police always flying overhead. In your head. You thought it normal. When boys disappeared, were shot, killed, cuffed or thrown onto a black and white hood for simply walking down the sidewalk. Or asking merely: <em>What have I done?</em> Normal. As expected as the orange poppies, your quiet state flower, blossoming on the side of the streets year-round.<br /><br />And then. Finally. You and I. Our bodies. Together. For a few hours: Time loves me. Every minute a gift so tender, each second announces itself. And then, just as quickly, equally: every second is stolen\u2014erased\u2014washed away\u2014<em>you</em>. I understand, somehow, it will be another four years until I see you again. We walk through the night, arm and arm, across the wet sidewalk, and\u2014besides my son\u2014I am the happiest I have ever been with another person. But it is a silence. A happiness that rare. Unexpected. Quiet. And I wait. And wait. And no one shoots you afterward. Or. Maybe this night was God\u2019s way of saying to me\u2014finally: <em>Yes, I do realize you exist.
