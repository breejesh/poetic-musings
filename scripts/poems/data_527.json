For days, I did not see\nMrs. Rufo. She must have been inside the house\nall that time. Meanwhile a big yellow garden spider\nbuilt his web above the plot of dirt and weeds \nand wildish plants that's just beside their outside staircase.\nIt's true that spiders are noiseless, I realized, \nwatching the spider in its nonstop industry, listening to the spider.\nAll of us have read \"A noiseless patient spider\u2026\" \nbut to hear, really, that absence of sound\nis something altogether different. Because the soundlessness\nis transparent and shaped like a geometric plane.  \nIt casts a silent white shadow that's bigger \nthan the spider is big, and when the spider dies, \nthe silence that replaces its silence \nis bigger than the spider's silence was big.\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Text Message", "view_node": "/poem/text-message", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/oni-buchanan\" hreflang=\"und\">Oni Buchanan</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <pre>oni, u rancorous scam, u  r  no rare ace.\nno common sense. no sure win.\nno amour. no sex. no career.\nno suave swimwear, size six.\nno amazonian eminence.\nno renaissance in consciousness.\nmere ire over asinine nuance.\nu  r  so mesozoic era.\n\nu rinse romaine + secure onions.\nu use sour cream on venison.\nu season noxious wieners.\ncoarse carnivore, u even wean + crisco sows  \n+ worse, simmer simian viscera   \n+ savor maximum cinnamon.\nmoreover, u evince ruinous manners.\n\never since u came,\nnauseous raccoons swoon + swerve near cars in manassas, va.\nimmense moose rave averse in maine.\nmonas wince in cameroon + zaire.\ncaimans careen in irreverence in so. american rivers.\nnice vicunas amaze in serious cusses.\newe emissions serve as severe consensus.\nvermin vow never near.\neven sea anemones voice censure.\nwrens, vireos, caracaras, anis, emus, swans, macaws, canaries + cranes\nmaroon u, swear avian au revoir.\nmessiaen concurs.\neminem weaves mean verses on u.\n\no, oni, scorn us now,\nnow ur careworn carcass awes us.\na carrion-crow carves ur cameo, no\nnovocaine. incisive. immune.\nnerve minus nerve is zero, or\nnoose, noon, nirvana: an\noceanic oasis. a rearview mirror.\ncan u recover now, oni?\ncan u crown ur cranium now, \ncan u rise in ur worm ascension?\n\nwe are ur vice, ur versus, ur\nvice-versa, ur mesmeric new avarice, \nur concussion, ur amnesia (a caesura is u now, oni.)\n(a caesura is ur new maison, ur caisson casa.)\nwe are ur arsenic, ur assassin, \nur anemia, ur anorexia nervosa.\nwe consume u, corrosive. we assess u.\nwe are ur vision, ur rescue mission, ur anima, \nu. we use u. ur winsome camera crew:\n\ncoroner, commence exam, + camera man, zoom in:\na waxen woman, wear-worse.\ncorneas, ears + nose aswarm.  \nsome recession on cranium.\nvenomous incisors, enormous.\nvaricose veins.\ncursive arms over cavernous core.  \nnurse: scissors, ammonia.  \ncarve in, coroner: mince, examine:\ncarmine amnion. uranium in urine.  \nin marrow, one amino amiss.\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Ars Poetica?
