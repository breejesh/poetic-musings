and three hundred cries to you,\nand I found nothing there but a bleating lamb.\n\nYou promised me a thing that was hard for you,\na ship of gold under a silver mast;\ntwelve towns with a market in all of them,\nand a fine white court by the side of the sea.\n\nYou promised me a thing that is not possible,\nthat you would give me gloves of the skin of a fish;\nthat you would give me shoes of the skin of a bird;\nand a suit of the dearest silk in Ireland.\n\nWhen I go by myself to the Well of Loneliness,\nI sit down and I go through my trouble;\nwhen I see the world and do not see my boy,\nhe that has an amber shade in his hair.\n\nIt was on that Sunday I gave my love to you;\nthe Sunday that is last before Easter Sunday.\nAnd myself on my knees reading the Passion;\nand my two eyes giving love to you for ever.\n\nMy mother said to me not to be talking with you today,\nor tomorrow, or on the Sunday;\nit was a bad time she took for telling me that;\nit was shutting the door after the house was robbed.\n\nMy heart is as black as the blackness of the sloe,\nor as the black coal that is on the smith's forge;\nor as the sole of a shoe left in white halls;\nit was you that put that darkness over my life.\n\nYou have taken the east from me; you have taken the west from me;\nyou have taken what is before me and what is behind me;\nyou have taken the moon, you have taken the sun

saw.\nAll other things to their destruction draw,\n    Only our love hath no decay;\nThis no to-morrow hath, nor yesterday;\nRunning it never runs from us away,\nBut truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.\n\n    Two graves must hide thine and my corse;\n    If one might, death were no divorce.\nAlas! as well as other princes, we\n\u2014Who prince enough in one another be\u2014\nMust leave at last in death these eyes and ears,\nOft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;\n    But souls where nothing dwells but love\n\u2014All other thoughts being inmates\u2014then shall prove\nThis or a love increas\u00e8d there above,\nWhen bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove.\n\n    And then we shall be throughly blest;\n    But now no more than all the rest.\nHere upon earth we're kings, and none but we\nCan be such kings, nor of such subjects be.\nWho is so safe as we? where none can do\nTreason to us, except one of us two.\n    True and false fears let us refrain,\nLet us love nobly, and live, and add again\nYears and years unto years, till we attain\nTo write threescore; this is the second of our reign.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Monna
