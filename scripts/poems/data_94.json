The ferry will leave without us. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Giannina: You have no idea how much I\u2019ve suffered under the influence of </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">this rigorous but retarded sardine. Not a warrior, but a soldier. Making me </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">vow to its regiment of passive-aggressive work. No traveling was allowed. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No smoking allowed. No pets allowed. No one could get near me </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">because the sardine would stink\u2014and its stink would bite. Sometimes it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">would fly around the rim, but it would always dive back into the can </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sardines\u2014looking for its paycheck. Every two weeks\u2014it brought me a </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">salary\u2014the stinky sardine\u2014and I brought home all I could buy with that </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">salary\u2014confinement, imprisonment. Depending on a salary made me </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">salivate\u2014but it blew my mind to dust\u2014the dust that blows around and </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">makes you cough\u2014but you hardly can see it because it\u2019s made of dust. But </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019m not made of dust\u2014I\u2019m made of flesh\u2014and making love to the little </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sardine drove me crazy. It was such a little fish it barely filled my mouth. I </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">could hardly eat it. I grew hungry\u2014hungry for a big fish. God help me\u2014no </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">more fish! Please no clams, no oysters! Please\u2014nothing shelled or scaled! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nothing salted\u2014nothing finned or fanged! Because it had fangs\u2014the </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sardine had fangs\u2014and it bit me like a rabid squirrel. It must have known I </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">wanted to bury it. Its fangs were long\u2014and its screams were shrill\u2014and it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">held grudges\u2014and it had bones to pick. It blamed me for keeping it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">down\u2014but all I wanted was its liberation from the can. I wanted it to </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">breathe clean air\u2014and to sing. Your mouth is already open\u2014now take a </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">deep breath, little fishy, and sing\u2014sing a song of love. You know my cords </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">are made of vibrant colors. You know I too come from the sea\u2014but I don\u2019t </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">come with grudges in my fangs. I come with wings to fly from your stink. I </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">hate sardines. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Zarathustra: Then why do you eat them? </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Giannina: Because I detest their helplessness. I wouldn\u2019t eat a lion. It would </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">eat me first. I eat what is weaker than me. I like lamb. I watch a grazing </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">lamb, and my mouth waters. I could eat it alive. But not sardines. They\u2019re </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">already dead. They never lived. They\u2019re dead even when they\u2019re alive. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Always with their mouths open. Begging for water. And I don\u2019t mind </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">beggars. But sardines are not beggars\u2014they\u2019re squirmers. They beg for </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">water\u2014but what they really want is to eat you alive\u2014with their </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">deadliness\u2014which is a plague\u2014a virus\u2014bacteria\u2014something contagious </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that kills you without killing you. They open their mouths to beg for </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">water\u2014but do nothing but gulp the draught and wait for water\u2014with their </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">mouths </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">open\u2014as if snoring, which is worse than imploring\u2014they\u2019re beggarly </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">beggars that don\u2019t even beg\u2014they\u2019re too dead to beg\u2014and they\u2019re deadly </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">contagious. It\u2019s their deadliness that lingers over me every day of my </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">life\u2014the dead inertia of the sardine that obeys and begs for water, gallons </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">water, and does what it\u2019s asked to do in spite of no water and denies itself </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so much\u2014that it doesn\u2019t realize it doesn\u2019t have a being anymore\u2014and it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">lets itself be canned\u2014always with its open mouth saying: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2014Drop dead, but give me drops of water. I don\u2019t want to be buried </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">alive. I want to survive. I\u2019m a salaried sardine. Give me more money. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That\u2019s why they\u2019re so salty and ugly, they itch and bite. Because they\u2019re </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">salivating for salty salaries\u2014salty salaried sardines. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Zarathustra: It is not a sardine.

Arr\u00e1ncale la </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">voz a la poes\u00eda. No dejes que te descubra, esc\u00f3ndete.

Entonces ins\u00faltala, por no haber</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">escrito con fuerza. Entonces ultr\u00e1jale los sue\u00f1os, abofet\u00e9ale los ojos. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Arrod\u00edllate y p\u00eddele perd\u00f3n. S\u00e1cale el poema del vientre. Du\u00e9rmete a su </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">lado, pero no la dejes de mirar. Escucha lo que en sue\u00f1os te dice. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Recon\u00f3cela cuando la veas deletrear los nombres del infierno. Desciende </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">con ella al infierno, sube por sus calles, arde dentro de su historia. No hay</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">nombres ni hay historia. Se precipita el volc\u00e1n y la lava est\u00e1 deseosa de </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">introducirse en el poema. No puedo menos que estrellarla contra una roca,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">no puedo menos que abrazarla. Ni puedo menos que insultarle los sue\u00f1os, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">ni puede menos que entreabrirme el poema, a medio decir, en silencio, sin </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">centinelas ni doncellas, con una lechuza y un buho para guardar la </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">distancia, para guardar el silencio, para presentarsedescalza. Y ella no </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pudo menos que estrellarse contra la roca, y el viento no pudo menos que </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">soplarle los cabellos, y el tiempo no pudo menos que eternizar su </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">momento. Y la poes\u00eda no est\u00e1 en todo el castillo, desaparece por la puerta </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">defuga, se va con el fuego que la quema y se disuelve en agua.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Poetry of the Night", "view_node": "/poem/poetry-night", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/giannina-braschi\" hreflang=\"en\">Giannina  Braschi</a>", "field_date_published": "1985", "body": "<blockquote><sup><em>translated by <a href=\"https://poets.org/poet/tess-odwyer\">Tess O\u2019Dwyer</a></em></sup></blockquote>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Poetry of a shark with two whales and a scarecrow.
