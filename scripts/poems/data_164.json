"2019", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">The most common thing in the world </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is a statue with its arms broken off.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The brokenness a flatness exposing the texture of the marble or clay.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The second most common thing are the arms. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The right to bear them. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which is something even those who do not want the right have.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Having something or someone to pray for </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">doesn\u2019t mean you have to pray. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who gave you something or someone to pray for, think of that. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the third most common thing, grass still wet </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from rain overnight, which you did not participate in by watching. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You were asleep in the fourth most common thing. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You wake now and walk on the fifth most common thing. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The smooth surface of it. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Without meaning to be reductive. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You say the name of a country to refer to its ongoing conflict.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The word <em>conflict</em> a rag that wipes the blade clean. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A clean blade above a fireplace is the sixth most common thing.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which means you have a neighbor, either </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to the east or west, who is currently displaying a weapon. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Even if you do not own a weapon, you could. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And because of this you are complicit. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But you cannot do anything about most things. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You cannot put the arms back onto a statue </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is another way of saying you can\u2019t put a bullet back into a gun. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The body subsumes bullets as though it is in love. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It inculcates bullets in the ways of the flesh.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which is torn by the time the bullet is convinced. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You aren\u2019t convinced of anything you don\u2019t already believe in.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In this way you are always standing your ground. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The ground under someone standing it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is the seventh most common thing. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The eighth is the air in which you openly carry. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You like the feel, the weight, the heft of it in your hand.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But mostly you like the ability to take another\u2019s life should you need to.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was your grandfather\u2019s ability, your father\u2019s. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Before you know it, it will be your child\u2019s. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose body in the fetal position resembles a finger curling over a trigger.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose whole life is still in the magazine. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Until it isn\u2019t and the sound is like that of a sternal saw </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">cutting through the breastbone of the world. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Finally buckling under the <em>tink, tink, tink</em> of the hammer against the saw.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And you thought you had hid the key to the drawer where you keep the gun.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But a key whose location is known is the ninth most common thing.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The tenth most common thing is a thoracic cavity </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">opened with a few cranks of the rib-spreader. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the esophagus and lungs are fished around by the hands of a surgeon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">who begins to massage the heart. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To clamp the aorta. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So that more blood is directed into the brain. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Instead of into the bowels, which have emptied by now. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While what is being filled are the gun racks of those. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose child is not on the table. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is not statuesque in the <em>beauty</em> sense of the word. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But in the way rigor mortis sets in. </span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Haw River Meditation", "view_node": "/poem/haw-river-meditation", "field_author": "<a
