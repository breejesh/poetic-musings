Sometimes, I screamed for hours, and my father\u2014I do remember this\u2014would push his chair up to the lip of the bassinet and smoke, as if he were keeping me company.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 After a few nights, he had broken me.\u00a0 I stopped crying.\u00a0 But, when he put the bottle to my lips, I didn\u2019t want it.\u00a0 I was too exhausted to drink.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>V.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Most times I liked my food.
