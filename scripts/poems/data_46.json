They heard him speak to the wife\u2019s</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">mother in the yard, tongue thick in his mouth, heavy with lamentation.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He could be the Aztec god of pestilence, no mask, breathing the plague</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on them through walls and doors. The Mexican nanny might be able\u00a0\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to read the hieroglyphics tumbling from his mouth, but she was wheeling\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a stroller through the streets of Alameda, the trees bowing deeply.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">On the news, the body-cam clip wobbles like the video at a barbecue.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The cops are cheerful as they encircle him in the park across the street.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He says his name is Mario. One cop scolds this refugee from Oakland about</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><em>drinking in our parks</em>, wants ID so they can be <em>on our merry way</em>. Mario says:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><em>Merry-go-round?</em> He steps up on a tree stump as if to ride it. The cops climb off</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the spinning horses of Mario\u2019s imagination, tugging at his arms as he peeks</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">at them under the cap. Now they are cowboys at the rodeo, but Mario is not</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a steer, crashing to the applause of hands that would carve him into steaks.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The cops shove him to the ground, facedown. Mario squirms and bucks;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">he is the prize at the county fair, a beast who tries to calm his captors,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so he spits all the words he knows to make them stop: <em>oh</em> <em>God, please,</em></span><br /><em><span class=\"long-line\">thank you</span></em>, and <em>sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.

There were no last words. In medieval days,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the prisoner at the block would forgive the headsman and drop a coin into</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his hand for a clean strike of the blade.
