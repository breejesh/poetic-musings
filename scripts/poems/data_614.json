We put our \nthings in the garage.    We lived among the woman's objects. \nI keep wondering if our furniture is still there.    You left it \nthere. \n\n<b>Chill the champagne and fix dessert first.</b>     We came back to \nthe house to see if we'd forgotten anything.     We left the piano \nand my dollhouse that time.    <i>I'm coming out of a twenty-first-\ncentury apartment.    There are many apartments like this--low, near \nthe ground, level, with sloping roofs, lanterns set into the stairs. </i>\n\nI woke up screaming for sleeping pills when I was sleeping on a \ncot in our empty kitchen. I was twelve that summer, the stairwells \nwere filling with huge moths.     I could hear them flying \nthrough the stairwell. \n\n<b>While cooking liquid for shrimp is reducing, start grilling the veg-\netables.</b>         The landlady came to talk to you about the \nback rent. I stayed in the bedroom like you told me to. You and \nshe had coffee and talked quietly.         The sheriff came a \nmonth later.     The next time, there were fists pounding on the \nheavy door for a while, and they were going to break it down. \nWe had our things put in storage in the night and stayed at a \nneighbor's. \n\nThey were very gentle women with large, sad eyes and all starving. \nThey had long, bony arms. They shared their breakfast with us. \n<b>Reheat shrimp and mushrooms in sauce just before pasta is done. </b>\n\n<i>The sky is empty and colorless. There are lawns, but few trees or shrubs. \nLanterns set near the ground along drives and sidewalks are the only \nbeautiful things.</i>    We stayed for a while at a relative's house. \nThey lived in an arboretum. The bay, exotic birds, and trees \nsurrounded us. I slept on an army cot. Everyone thought I would \nlike sharing my cousin's room, the lace curtains, frilly girl's \nbedding, shells, earrings, closet full of girl's clothing, dolls, porce-\nlain animals, her white furniture with gold trim \"just like\" my \nfurniture.     When I was in the room by myself, I could almost \npretend it was my own room, but when my cousin was there, it \nbecame hers again. I spent hours riding my bike along the trails \nduring the warm fall, the trees making a shelter above me with \ntheir interwoven boughs. \n\n<b>To make dessert, peel four (preferably seedless) oranges, \nremoving as much of the white pith as possible.

They're great accompanied by really decadent chocolate \ntruffles. </b>\n\nWe had our things again in our new apartment.    But the \neviction notices and bill collectors began coming again. The new \nplace we moved to was rundown, and the neighbors kept a wild \ndog in a cage near their property line to guard it. They never let \nthe dog out. We went over to introduce ourselves when they were \nhaving a yard sale. The mother kept her children near her and \nhad a tight, very polite smile.     My room was lavender. \n\nSometimes the heat shut off in the middle of the night, and my \nmother would go outside in the cold in her nightgown to go down\nto the basement to switch the furnace back on.     And my \nmother heated water on the stove so that I could wash my hair. \nThere were ants in the kitchen cupboards, and they poured out of \na box of cereal when I was pouring out a bowl for breakfast. I \nthrew it on the floor and ran to school. \n\n<b>Saut\u00e9 mushrooms in a medium saucepan in hot olive oil over \nmedium-high heat.

I don't want to \nleave these things. As I live there, I become attached to the apartment, \nits rooms.     The houses along my walk to the bank remind me of the \nneighborhood where I grew up--low, small ranch houses.    I realize \nthey had looked much bigger when I was a child.
