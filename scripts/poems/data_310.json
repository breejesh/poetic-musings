Then the French neighbor gardening in her silk blouse hints chemicals might take care of the grasses on our side, the ones choking the basil. But I say bittersweet or Japanese creeper on the fence, what\u2019s the difference. She\u2019s saying it again. \u201cSweet Autumn Clematis should be more vigorous than the large-flowered clematis hybrids.\u201d And on the internet: \u201cI know she fought with every ounce of strength.\u201d Or, \u201cShe died peacefully at home.\u201d An appropriate response to this: bullshit. She wrote so many books. She is writing so many books. All of these books undulate from her like swells, like the yellow liquid left in the tube after selling platelets. I\u2019m not saying vampiric when I think of everything going wrong in the blood. Or the tubes carrying blood. Or blood keeps going where it shouldn\u2019t in quantities the brain can\u2019t handle. When he took a job counseling terminal patients, when he no longer had clients but patients, then he had the stroke. He stroked. Who knows how to respond to this? During surgeries, I watched the blood spinning through tubes, getting aerated, oxygenated, whipped up and sent back to the limbs. I wished there was less hard blue plastic, less crisscrossing of tubes and wires. My nightmares in recent years involve violating the sterile field. I touch my neck, then I touch the edge of the wound, and I am filled with shame but also fear because maybe now there\u2019s nothing to be done since I\u2019ve contaminated the chest cavity and the patient will most likely move on to infection, fever, death, but I won\u2019t know because, one, I\u2019ll wake up or, two, <em>wakes up</em> will stop mattering. Option three involves me trying to cry in the locker room bathroom but instead wanting a sandwich, not knowing the patient\u2019s <em>name</em> anyway. I\u2019m on the hunt here, following the vine to its root only to find it\u2019s one vine among twelve and we\u2019d better get the shovel or decide this is probably just wisteria that hasn\u2019t bloomed yet. In a nightmare, I once vomited on a patient. I just missed the chest cavity. Awake, I really did drop many valuable things. One of the things given to me to hold was the heart itself. I never held a warm heart but sometimes wish I had. I think I would have cried more for a warm heart that refused to restart. The cold ones, nesting in sterile ice, never inspired hope of life. The real difference between a surgery that ends well and one that doesn\u2019t is the way the body is closed. If the surgery is successful, then the patient\u2019s heart restarts and the pressure comes up. A regular rhythm is achieved and we close each layer\u2014heart, sternum, any little blood vessels, fat, each layer of dermis. If the heart does not restart, there is no careful sewing. A staple gun closes the skin but not the layers underneath. The sternum is still pulled closed with wires, but fewer and less neatly tied. I grab the incision\u2019s edges, tug them together with one hand, and with the other, start the grating plastic <em>click click click</em> of the gun. The table is pulled away and the drapes peeled off the skin. We wipe away the blood and the betadine. We pull the blanket to the chin. I never stick around to see what happens next.

The neighbors hate the stench and the flies but he continues to pour blood over the bodies until he is ordered by the police to stop. Only then does he use formaldehyde. He isn\u2019t preserving the flesh, just refreshing it, maintaining the life-color of the carcass and painting that blood as lush. He is not emulating and there is no reminiscence. When Soutine\u2019s last privately owned carcass painting, <em>Le boeuf \u00e9corch\u00e9</em>, was auctioned recently, the seller expected to get something like seven to eight million dollars. In the catalog description, Christie\u2019s lingers over Soutine\u2019s early intense poverty and the sudden relief of that poverty when he sold a large number of paintings to a banker. <em>Le boeuf \u00e9corch\u00e9</em> represents a point at which Soutine could afford to buy whole beef sides just to look at rather than eat. <em>Le boeuf</em> sold for fourteen million dollars, which I find depressing. Or it misses the point. If anyone blends the line between still life and portrait, it\u2019s Soutine. The still life reflects portraiture without any deliberate reminiscence. Soutine\u2019s brothers beat him mercilessly. Their cruelty became a ritual. One day when Soutine was sixteen, he approached a pious Jew to ask him to pose for a portrait. The next day this man\u2019s son and his friends beat Soutine. It was a week before he walked again. Why is this story retold so often? I don\u2019t think I create heroes in my portraits in the conventional romantic or poetic sense. Soutine fights against the monsters. He fights against neuroticism and fear. His portrait can be made in many ways but always the same image. Sometimes, in fact, I make the same portrait. Say <em>Still Life with</em> <em>Rayfish</em>. It could have been a fairytale. My way of making a fable from the portrait is my way of telling it. I simply told it as I did. But our hero is really there: the one in the portrait who possesses the feel of his own life. This is part of Soutine\u2019s process also: to see the forbidden thing and paint it, to severely constrict his subject within the frame and enclose space. He imprisons the image within the image. In Chardin\u2019s <em>Rayfish</em>, the ray at rest has become a ghost already, nearly translucent at the mouth and eyes. In <em>Still Life with Rayfish</em>, Soutine attempts a portrait of Chardin. This ray rises howling from the table, its membranous belly shuddering. Its entrails glow with warmth. <em>Today you will eat dead things and make them into something living:</em> <em>but when you will be in light, what will you do then? For then you</em> <em>become two instead of one; and when you become two, what will you do</em> <em>then?</em> Do I mean that in all our portraits we tell the same story? But I can\u2019t say I have a special direction, although I feel a certain evolution in myself, in the ways I find of saying things. Let\u2019s call this a transition from attention to grace. When Soutine works in serial, painting the same object again and again, the paintings convulse. Seen side-by-side, their convulsions evoke sensation. I see great possibilities by shifting the wings, moving the feathers or necks. Swirling, lacerated flesh swells against blue or red or green backgrounds. The figure of the bird, whirling fowl of penitence, beats even as darker backdrops threaten to swallow it. <em>The body which depends upon a body is unfortunate, and the</em> <em>soul which depends upon these two is unfortunate</em>. In this first portrait of the rayfish, the ray is pulled up by its wings, each wing pierced with wire hung from the stone wall behind. Or the next ray hovers over the table, ascending; it swoops midair. Soutine presents the butchered animal opened, taken to pieces, bloody, glistening, shimmering yet conspicuously dead. I devour a skin that is grotesque with demonic aura, the terror and humor of its textures. I paint a skin made from sheer white curtains blowing at windows in stark sun. I make a figure from gray feathers stuck to my neck with sweat. I build whole visions of life out of the swirling black velvet of a woman\u2019s dress as she wades into water. That wet velvet billows, a second skin, sensual, dragging her under, pulling her out to sea. In <em>La Dolce Vita</em>, the soft, dark flesh of the monstrous ray is bound tightly by the fishermen\u2019s net as the ray is hauled onto the beach. \u201cYou will make a million with this fish!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s alive!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been dead three days.\u201d Rolled onto its back, its mouth pulls open and one black eye stares back. Its slick surface resembles the protoplasmic source of all things. It insists on looking. The guardian angel of Adrian Lyne\u2019s <em>Jacob\u2019s Ladder</em> quotes Meister Eckhart to the dying Jacob: \u201cEckhart saw hell too. He said: \u2018the only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won\u2019t let go of your life, your memories, your attachments. They burn them all away. But they\u2019re not punishing you,\u2019 he said. \u2018They\u2019re freeing your soul. . . . If you\u2019ve made your peace, then the devils are really angels freeing you from the Earth.\u2019\u201d I imagine the nets around the rayfish as sutures pulled from its flesh, releasing the wings to unfold. I picture the scarred eyes of the surgeon\u2019s attendant in <em>Jacob\u2019s Ladder</em> as two layers of flesh folded over. Bones and lumps of flesh piled in the hallway, faces both vacant and badly twisted: Lyne\u2019s \u201cbody horror technique.\u201d The face moves with an alien speed, a filmic sensation of seizure, fit, possession, mutation. <em>He who</em> <em>has known the world has fallen into the body, and he that has fallen</em> <em>into the body, the world is not worthy of him.</em> The ray\u2019s blank eye and the attending angel\u2019s carved sockets equally terrify. Soutine\u2019s eddies in oil capture the ray\u2019s flesh. He structures my seeing; he imparts vision. I pamper this slight ghost\u2014I encourage it. It takes shape slowly. It takes possession. \u201cOnce I saw the village butcher slice the neck of bird and drain the blood out of it. I wanted to cry out, but his joyful expression caught the sound in my throat.\u201d Soutine pats his throat and continues, \u201cThis cry, I always feel it there. When, as a child, I drew a crude portrait of my professor, I tried to rid myself of this cry, but in vain. When I painted the beef carcass it was still this cry that I wanted to liberate. I have still not succeeded.\u201d</p> "}, {"title": "Beautiful Thinking", "view_node": "/poem/beautiful-thinking", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/angie-estes\" hreflang=\"und\">Angie Estes</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each morning, before the sun rises<br />over the bay of Villefranche-sur-Mer<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0on the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, cruise ships drop anchor</p><p>so that motor launches from shore<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0can nurse alongside.

I dream</p><p>my muzzle\u2019s pressed<br />desperately into the whiskered</p><p>belly of my dead mother. No<br />milk there. I dream</p><p>I slumber in a cardboard box<br />in a human kitchen, wishing, while</p><p>a woman I don\u2019t love<br />mushes corn for me in a dish.

I pray</p><p>to God to give me<br />the ability to write</p><p>better poems than the poems of those<br />whom I despise. But</p><p>before spring comes, my neighbor\u2019s<br />pigs die in her kitchen</p><p>one by one, and I<br />catch a glimpse of my own face</p><p>in the empty collection plate, looking<br />up at me, hungrily, one</p><p>Sunday\u2014pink, and smudged\u2014and ask it<br /><em>Isn\u2019t that enough? </em></p> "}], "pager": {"current_page": 310, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
