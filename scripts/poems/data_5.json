did not wear his scarlet coat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For blood and wine are red,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And blood and wine were on his hands</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0When they found him with the dead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The poor dead woman whom he loved,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And murdered in her bed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He walked amongst the Trial Men</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In a suit of shabby grey;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A cricket cap was on his head,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And his step seemed light and gay;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I never saw a man who looked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0So wistfully at the day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I never saw a man who looked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With such a wistful eye</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Upon that little tent of blue</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Which prisoners call the sky,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And at every drifting cloud that went</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With sails of silver by.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I walked, with other souls in pain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Within another ring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And was wondering if the man had done</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0A great or little thing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When a voice behind me whispered low,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\"<em>That fellow's got to swing.</em>\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Dear Christ! the very prison walls</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly seemed to reel,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the sky above my head became</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Like a casque of scorching steel;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, though I was a soul in pain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0My pain I could not feel.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I only knew what hunted thought</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Quickened his step, and why</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He looked upon the garish day</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With such a wistful eye;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The man had killed the thing he loved</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And so he had to die.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Yet each man kills the thing he loves</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0By each let this be heard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some do it with a bitter look,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Some with a flattering word,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The coward does it with a kiss,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The brave man with a sword!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Some kill their love when they are young,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And some when they are old;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some strangle with the hands of Lust,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Some with the hands of Gold:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The kindest use a knife, because</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The dead so soon grow cold.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Some love too little, some too long,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Some sell, and others buy;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some do the deed with many tears,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And some without a sigh:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For each man kills the thing he loves,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Yet each man does not die.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He does not die a death of shame</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0On a day of dark disgrace,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor have a noose about his neck,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Nor a cloth upon his face,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor drop feet foremost through the floor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Into an empty place</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He does not sit with silent men</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Who watch him night and day;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who watch him when he tries to weep,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And when he tries to pray;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who watch him lest himself should rob</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The prison of its prey.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He does not wake at dawn to see</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Dread figures throng his room,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The shivering Chaplain robed in white,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The Sheriff stern with gloom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the Governor all in shiny black,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With the yellow face of Doom.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He does not rise in piteous haste</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To put on convict-clothes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats, and notes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Each new and nerve-twitched pose,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fingering a watch whose little ticks</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Are like horrible hammer-blows.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He does not know that sickening thirst</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That sands one's throat, before</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The hangman with his gardener's gloves</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Slips through the padded door,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And binds one with three leathern thongs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That the throat may thirst no more.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He does not bend his head to hear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The Burial Office read,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor, while the terror of his soul</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Tells him he is not dead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cross his own coffin, as he moves</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Into the hideous shed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He does not stare upon the air</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Through a little roof of glass;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He does not pray with lips of clay</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For his agony to pass;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor feel upon his shuddering cheek</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The kiss of Caiaphas.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">II</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Six weeks our guardsman walked the yard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In a suit of shabby grey:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His cricket cap was on his head,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And his step seemed light and gay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I never saw a man who looked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0So wistfully at the day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I never saw a man who looked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With such a wistful eye</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Upon that little tent of blue</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Which prisoners call the sky,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And at every wandering cloud that trailed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Its raveled fleeces by.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He did not wring his hands, as do</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Those witless men who dare</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To try to rear the changeling Hope</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In the cave of black Despair:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He only looked upon the sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And drank the morning air.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He did not wring his hands nor weep,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Nor did he peek or pine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But he drank the air as though it held</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Some healthful anodyne;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With open mouth he drank the sun</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0As though it had been wine!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And I and all the souls in pain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Who tramped the other ring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Forgot if we ourselves had done</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0A great or little thing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And watched with gaze of dull amaze</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The man who had to swing.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And strange it was to see him pass</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With a step so light and gay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And strange it was to see him look</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0So wistfully at the day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And strange it was to think that he</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Had such a debt to pay.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For oak and elm have pleasant leaves</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That in the spring-time shoot:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But grim to see is the gallows-tree,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With its adder-bitten root,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, green or dry, a man must die</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Before it bears its fruit!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The loftiest place is that seat of grace</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For which all worldlings try:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But who would stand in hempen band</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Upon a scaffold high,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And through a murderer's collar take</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0His last look at the sky?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It is sweet to dance to violins</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0When Love and Life are fair:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To dance to flutes, to dance to lutes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is delicate and rare:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But it is not sweet with nimble feet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To dance upon the air!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So with curious eyes and sick surmise</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0We watched him day by day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And wondered if each one of us</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Would end the self-same way,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For none can tell to what red Hell</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0His sightless soul may stray.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">At last the dead man walked no more</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Amongst the Trial Men,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I knew that he was standing up</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In the black dock's dreadful pen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And that never would I see his face</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In God's sweet world again.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Like two doomed ships that pass in storm</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0We had crossed each other's way:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But we made no sign, we said no word,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0We had no word to say;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For we did not meet in the holy night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0But in the shameful day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A prison wall was round us both,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Two outcast men were we:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The world had thrust us from its heart,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And God from out His care:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the iron gin that waits for Sin</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Had caught us in its snare.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">III</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And the dripping wall is high,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So it was there he took the air</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Beneath the leaden sky,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And by each side a Warder walked,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For fear the man might die.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Or else he sat with those who watched</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0His anguish night and day;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who watched him when he rose to weep,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And when he crouched to pray;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who watched him lest himself should rob</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Their scaffold of its prey.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The Governor was strong upon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The Regulations Act:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Doctor said that Death was but</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0A scientific fact:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And twice a day the Chaplain called</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And left a little tract.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And twice a day he smoked his pipe,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And drank his quart of beer:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His soul was resolute, and held</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0No hiding-place for fear;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He often said that he was glad</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The hangman's hands were near.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But why he said so strange a thing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0No Warder dared to ask:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For he to whom a watcher's doom</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is given as his task,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Must set a lock upon his lips,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And make his face a mask.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Or else he might be moved, and try</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To comfort or console:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And what should Human Pity do</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Pent up in Murderers' Hole?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What word of grace in such a place</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Could help a brother's soul?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With slouch and swing around the ring</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0We trod the Fool's Parade!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We did not care: we knew we were</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The Devil's Own Brigade:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And shaven head and feet of lead</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Make a merry masquerade.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We tore the tarry rope to shreds</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With blunt and bleeding nails;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And cleaned the shining rails:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And clattered with the pails.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0We turned the dusty drill:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And sweated on the mill:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But in the heart of every man</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Terror was lying still.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So still it lay that every day</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Crawled like a weed-clogged wave:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And we forgot the bitter lot</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That waits for fool and knave</span><br />\n, <span class=\"long-line\">Till once, as we tramped in from work,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0We passed an open grave.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With yawning mouth the yellow hole</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Gaped for a living thing;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The very mud cried out for blood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To the thirsty asphalte ring:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And we knew that ere one dawn grew fair</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Some prisoner had to swing.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Right in we went, with soul intent</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0On Death and Dread and Doom:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The hangman, with his little bag,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Went shuffling through the gloom</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And each man trembled as he crept</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Into his numbered tomb.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">That night the empty corridors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Were full of forms of Fear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And up and down the iron town</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Stole feet we could not hear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And through the bars that hide the stars</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0White faces seemed to peer.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He lay as one who lies and dreams</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In a pleasant meadow-land,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The watcher watched him as he slept,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And could not understand</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How one could sleep so sweet a sleep</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With a hangman close at hand?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But there is no sleep when men must weep</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Who never yet have wept:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So we\u2014the fool, the fraud, the knave\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That endless vigil kept,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And through each brain on hands of pain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Another's terror crept.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Alas! it is a fearful thing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To feel another's guilt!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For, right within, the sword of Sin</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Pierced to its poisoned hilt,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as molten lead were the tears we shed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For the blood we had not spilt.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The Warders with their shoes of felt</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Crept by each padlocked door,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Grey figures on the floor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And wondered why men knelt to pray</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Who never prayed before.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">All through the night we knelt and prayed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Mad mourners of a corpse!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The troubled plumes of midnight were</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The plumes upon a hearse:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And bitter wine upon a sponge</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Was the savior of Remorse.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The cock crew, the red cock crew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0But never came the day:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And crooked shape of Terror crouched,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In the corners where we lay:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And each evil sprite that walks by night</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Before us seemed to play.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They glided past, they glided fast,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Like travelers through a mist:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They mocked the moon in a rigadoon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Of delicate turn and twist,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with formal pace and loathsome grace</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The phantoms kept their tryst.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With mop and mow, we saw them go,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Slim shadows hand in hand:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">About, about, in ghostly rout</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0They trod a saraband:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the damned grotesques made arabesques,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Like the wind upon the sand!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With the pirouettes of marionettes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0They tripped on pointed tread:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0As their grisly masque they led,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And loud they sang, and loud they sang,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For they sang to wake the dead.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><em>\"Oho!\"</em> they cried, <em>\"The world is wide,</em></span><br /><em><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0But fettered limbs go lame!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And once, or twice, to throw the dice</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is a gentlemanly game,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But he does not win who plays with Sin</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In the secret House of Shame.\"</span></em></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No things of air these antics were</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That frolicked with such glee:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To men whose lives were held in gyves,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And whose feet might not go free,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Most terrible to see.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Around, around, they waltzed and wound;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Some wheeled in smirking pairs:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With the mincing step of demirep</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Some sidled up the stairs:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Each helped us at our prayers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The morning wind began to moan,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0But still the night went on:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through its giant loom the web of gloom</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Crept till each thread was spun:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as we prayed, we grew afraid</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Of the Justice of the Sun.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The moaning wind went wandering round</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The weeping prison-wall:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till like a wheel of turning-steel</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0We felt the minutes crawl:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">O moaning wind! what had we done</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To have such a seneschal?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">At last I saw the shadowed bars</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Like a lattice wrought in lead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Move right across the whitewashed wall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That faced my three-plank bed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I knew that somewhere in the world</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0God's dreadful dawn was red.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">At six o'clock we cleaned our cells,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0At seven all was still,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the sough and swing of a mighty wing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The prison seemed to fill,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the Lord of Death with icy breath</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Had entered in to kill.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He did not pass in purple pomp,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Nor ride a moon-white steed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Three yards of cord and a sliding board</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Are all the gallows' need:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So with rope of shame the Herald came</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To do the secret deed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We were as men who through a fen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Of filthy darkness grope:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We did not dare to breathe a prayer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Or give our anguish scope:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Something was dead in each of us,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And what was dead was Hope.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For Man's grim Justice goes its way,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And will not swerve aside:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It slays the weak, it slays the strong,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0It has a deadly stride:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With iron heel it slays the strong,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The monstrous parricide!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We waited for the stroke of eight:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Each tongue was thick with thirst:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That makes a man accursed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Fate will use a running noose</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For the best man and the worst.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We had no other thing to do,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Save to wait for the sign to com</span><br />\ne: <span class=\"long-line\">So, like things of stone in a valley lone,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Quiet we sat and dumb:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But each man's heart beat thick and quick</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Like a madman on a drum!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With sudden shock the prison-clock</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Smote on the shivering air,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And from all the gaol rose up a wail</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Of impotent despair,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the sound that frightened marshes hear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0From a leper in his lair.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And as one sees most fearful things</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In the crystal of a dream,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We saw the greasy hempen rope</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Hooked to the blackened beam,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And heard the prayer the hangman's snare</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Strangled into a scream.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And all the woe that moved him so</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That he gave that bitter cry,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0None knew so well as I:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For he who lives more lives than one</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0More deaths than one must die.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">IV</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There is no chapel on the day</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0On which they hang a man:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Chaplain's heart is far too sick,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Or his face is far too wan,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or there is that written in his eyes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Which none should look upon.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So they kept us close till nigh on noon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And then they rang the bell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the Warders with their jingling keys</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Opened each listening cell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And down the iron stair we tramped,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Each from his separate Hell.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Out into God's sweet air we went,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0But not in wonted way,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For this man's face was white with fear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And that man's face was grey,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I never saw sad men who looked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0So wistfully at the day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I never saw sad men who looked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With such a wistful eye</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Upon that little tent of blue</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0We prisoners called the sky,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And at every careless cloud that passed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In happy freedom by.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But there were those amongst us all</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Who walked with downcast head,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And knew that, had each got his due,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0They should have died instead:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He had but killed a thing that lived</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Whilst they had killed the dead.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For he who sins a second time</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Wakes a dead soul to pain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And draws it from its spotted shroud,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And makes it bleed again,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And makes it bleed great gouts of blood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And makes it bleed in vain!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Like ape or clown, in monstrous garb</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With crooked arrows starred,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silently we went round and round</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The slippery asphalte yard;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silently we went round and round,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And no man spoke a word.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Silently we went round and round,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And through each hollow mind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The memory of dreadful things</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Rushed like a dreadful wind,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Horror stalked before each man,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And terror crept behind.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The Warders strutted up and down,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And kept their herd of brutes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their uniforms were spick and span,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And they wore their Sunday suits,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But we knew the work they had been at</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0By the quicklime on their boots.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For where a grave had opened wide,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0There was no grave at all:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only a stretch of mud and sand</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0By the hideous prison-wall,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And a little heap of burning lime,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That the man should have his pall.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For he has a pall, this wretched man,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Such as few men can claim:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Deep down below a prison-yard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Naked for greater shame,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He lies, with fetters on each foot,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Wrapt in a sheet of flame!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And all the while the burning lime</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Eats flesh and bone away,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It eats the brittle bone by night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And the soft flesh by the day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It eats the flesh and bones by turns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0But it eats the heart alway.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For three long years they will not sow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Or root or seedling there:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For three long years the unblessed spot</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Will sterile be and bare,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And look upon the wondering sky</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With unreproachful stare.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They think a murderer's heart would taint</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Each simple seed they sow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is not true! God's kindly earth</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is kindlier than men know,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the red rose would but blow more red,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The white rose whiter blow.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Out of his mouth a red, red rose!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Out of his heart a white!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For who can say by what strange way,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Christ brings his will to light,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since the barren staff the pilgrim bore</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Bloomed in the great Pope's sight?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But neither milk-white rose nor red</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0May bloom in prison air;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The shard, the pebble, and the flint,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Are what they give us there:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For flowers have been known to heal</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0A common man's despair.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So never will wine-red rose or white,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Petal by petal, fall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On that stretch of mud and sand that lies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0By the hideous prison-wall,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To tell the men who tramp the yard</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">&lt;7nbsp;\u00a0That God's Son died for all.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Yet though the hideous prison-wall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Still hems him round and round,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And a spirit man not walk by night</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That is with fetters bound,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And a spirit may not weep that lies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In such unholy ground,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He is at peace\u2014this wretched man\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0At peace, or will be soon:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There is no thing to make him mad,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Nor does Terror walk at noon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the lampless Earth in which he lies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Has neither Sun nor Moon.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They hanged him as a beast is hanged:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0They did not even toll</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A reguiem that might have brought</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Rest to his startled soul,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But hurriedly they took him out,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And hid him in a hole.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They stripped him of his canvas clothes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And gave him to the flies;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They mocked the swollen purple throat</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And the stark and staring eyes:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with laughter loud they heaped the shroud</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In which their convict lies.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The Chaplain would not kneel to pray</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0By his dishonored grave:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor mark it with that blessed Cross</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That Christ for sinners gave,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Because the man was one of those</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Whom Christ came down to save.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Yet all is well; he has but passed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To Life's appointed bourne:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And alien tears will fill for him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Pity's long-broken urn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For his mourner will be outcast men,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And outcasts always mourn.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">V</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I know not whether Laws be right,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Or whether Laws be wrong;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All that we know who lie in gaol</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is that the wall is strong;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And that each day is like a year,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0A year whose days are long.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But this I know, that every Law</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That men have made for Man,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since first Man took his brother's life,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And the sad world began,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But straws the wheat and saves the chaff</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With a most evil fan.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This too I know\u2014and wise it were</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0If each could know the same\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That every prison that men build</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is built with bricks of shame,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And bound with bars lest Christ should see</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0How men their brothers maim.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With bars they blur the gracious moon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And blind the goodly sun:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And they do well to hide their Hell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For in it things are done</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That Son of God nor son of Man</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Ever should look upon!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The vilest deeds like poison weeds</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Bloom well in prison-air:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is only what is good in Man</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That wastes and withers there:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And the Warder is Despair</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For they starve the little frightened child</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Till it weeps both night and day:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And gibe the old and grey,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And some grow mad, and all grow bad,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And none a word may say.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Each narrow cell in which we dwell</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is foul and dark latrine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the fetid breath of living Death</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Chokes up each grated screen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And all, but Lust, is turned to dust</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In Humanity's machine.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The brackish water that we drink</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Creeps with a loathsome slime,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the bitter bread they weigh in scales</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is full of chalk and lime,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Sleep will not lie down, but walks</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Wild-eyed and cries to Time.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But though lean Hunger and green Thirst</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Like asp with adder fight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We have little care of prison fare,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For what chills and kills outright</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is that every stone one lifts by day</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Becomes one's heart by night.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With midnight always in one's heart,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And twilight in one's cell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We turn the crank, or tear the rope,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Each in his separate Hell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the silence is more awful far</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Than the sound of a brazen bell.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And never a human voice comes near</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0To speak a gentle word:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the eye that watches through the door</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Is pitiless and hard:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And by all forgot, we rot and rot,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With soul and body marred.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And thus we rust Life's iron chain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Degraded and alone:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And some men curse, and some men weep,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And some men make no moan:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But God's eternal Laws are kind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And break the heart of stone.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And every human heart that breaks,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In prison-cell or yard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is as that broken box that gave</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Its treasure to the Lord,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And filled the unclean leper's house</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With the scent of costliest nard.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Ah! happy day they whose hearts can break</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And peace of pardon win!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How else may man make straight his plan</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And cleanse his soul from Sin?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How else but through a broken heart</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0May Lord Christ enter in?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And he of the swollen purple throat.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And the stark and staring eyes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waits for the holy hands that took</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The Thief to Paradise;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And a broken and a contrite heart</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The Lord will not despise.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The man in red who reads the Law</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Gave him three weeks of life,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Three little weeks in which to heal</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0His soul of his soul's strife,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And cleanse from every blot of blood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The hand that held the knife.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The hand that held the steel:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For only blood can wipe out blood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And only tears can heal:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the crimson stain that was of Cain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Became Christ's snow-white seal.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">VI</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In Reading gaol by Reading town</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0There is a pit of shame,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in it lies a wretched man</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Eaten by teeth of flame,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In burning winding-sheet he lies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And his grave has got no name.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And there, till Christ call forth the dead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In silence let him lie:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No need to waste the foolish tear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Or heave the windy sigh:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The man had killed the thing he loved,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And so he had to die.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And all men kill the thing they love,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0By all let this be heard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some do it with a bitter look,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Some with a flattering word,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The coward does it with a kiss,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The brave man with a sword!</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "The Red Wheelbarrow", "view_node": "/poem/red-wheelbarrow", "field_author": "<a
