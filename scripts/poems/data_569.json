Each throat\non which I would have quietly set my lips\nwill be ripped like a cheap sleeve\nor blown apart like the stopped-up\nbarrel of a gun. What was inside them\nall the time I wanted always\nto rest my mouth upon?\n\nI thought most everything\nstuck dartlike in the half-dome of my brain,\nand hung there like fake stars in a planetarium.\nIt's true that things there changed into names,\nthat even the people I loved were a bunch of signs,\nso I felt most often alone.\nThis is a way to stay alive and nothing to bemoan.\nWe know the first time we extend an arm:\nthe body reaches so far for so long.\nWe grow and love to grow, then stop, then lie down.\n\nI wanted to bear inside me this tender outcome.\nI wanted to know if it made sex happen:\ndoes it show up surely in touch and talk?\ndoes it leak from the mind, as heat from the skin?\nI wanted my touching intelligent, like a beautiful song.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Past", "view_node": "/poem/past-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/michael-ryan\" hreflang=\"und\">Michael Ryan</a>", "field_date_published": "2004", "body": " <pre>\nIt shows up one summer in a greatcoat,\nstorms through the house confiscating,\nsays it must be paid and quickly,\nsays it must take everything.\n\nYour children stare into their cornflakes,\nyour wife whispers only once to stop it,\nbecause she loves you and she sees it\ndarken the room suddenly like a stain.\n\nWhat did you do to deserve it,\nruining breakfast on a balmy day?\nKiss your loved ones.

class=\"long-line\">One whistled like a bird.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But sweet-tooth Laura spoke in haste:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cGood folk, I have no

/><span class=\"long-line\">Fruits which that unknown orchard bore;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She suck\u2019d until her lips were sore;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then flung the

the glen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the haunts of goblin men.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you not remember Jeanie,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How she met them in the moonlight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Took their gifts both choice and many,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ate their fruits and wore their flowers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pluck\u2019d from bowers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where summer ripens at all hours?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But ever in the noonlight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She pined and pined away;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sought them by night and day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Found them no more, but dwindled and grew grey;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then fell with the first snow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While to this day no grass will grow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where she lies low:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I planted daisies there a year ago</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That never blow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You should not loiter so.\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cNay, hush,\u201d said Laura:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cNay, hush, my sister:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I ate and ate

class=\"long-line\">Air\u2019d and set to rights the house,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Kneaded cakes of whitest wheat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cakes for dainty mouths to eat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Next churn\u2019d butter, whipp\u2019d up cream,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fed their poultry, sat and sew\u2019d;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Talk\u2019d as modest maidens should:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lizzie with an open heart,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laura in an absent dream,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One content, one sick in part;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One warbling for the mere bright day\u2019s delight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One longing for the night.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">At length slow evening came:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They went with pitchers to the reedy brook;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lizzie most placid in her look,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laura most like a leaping flame.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They drew the gurgling water from its deep;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lizzie pluck\u2019d purple and rich golden flags,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then turning homeward said: \u201cThe sunset flushes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Those furthest loftiest crags;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come, Laura, not another maiden lags.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No wilful squirrel wags,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The beasts and birds are fast asleep.\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But Laura loiter\u2019d still among the rushes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And said the bank was steep.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And said the hour was early still</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The dew not fall\u2019n, the wind not chill;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Listening ever, but not catching</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The customary cry,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cCome buy, come buy,\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With its iterated jingle</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of sugar-baited words:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not for all her watching</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Once discerning even one goblin</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Racing, whisking, tumbling, hobbling;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Let alone the herds</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That used to tramp along the glen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In groups or single,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of brisk fruit-merchant men.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Till Lizzie urged, \u201cO Laura, come;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I hear the fruit-call but I dare not look:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You should not loiter longer at this brook:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come with me home.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The stars rise, the moon bends her arc,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each glowworm winks her spark,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Let us get home before the night grows dark:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For clouds may gather</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though this is summer weather,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Put out the lights and drench us through;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then if we lost our way what should we do?\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Laura turn\u2019d cold as stone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To find her sister heard that cry alone,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That goblin cry,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cCome buy our fruits, come buy.\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Must she then buy no more such dainty fruit?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Must she no more such succous pasture find,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gone deaf and blind?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her tree of life droop\u2019d from the root:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She said not one word in her heart\u2019s sore ache;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But peering thro\u2019 the dimness, nought discerning,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Trudg\u2019d home, her pitcher dripping all the way;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So crept to bed, and lay</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent till Lizzie slept;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then sat up in a passionate yearning,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And gnash\u2019d her teeth for baulk\u2019d desire, and wept</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if her heart would break.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Day after day, night after night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laura kept watch in vain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In sullen silence of exceeding pain.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She never caught again the goblin cry:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cCome buy, come buy;\u201d\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She never spied the goblin men</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hawking their fruits along the glen:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when the noon wax\u2019d bright</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her hair grew thin and grey;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She dwindled, as the fair full moon doth turn</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To swift decay and burn</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her fire away.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">One day remembering her kernel-stone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She set it by a wall that faced the south;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dew\u2019d it with tears, hoped for a root,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Watch\u2019d for a waxing shoot,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But there came none;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It never saw the sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It never felt the trickling moisture run:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While with sunk eyes and faded mouth</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She dream\u2019d of melons, as a traveller sees</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">False waves in desert drouth</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With shade of leaf-crown\u2019d trees,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And burns the thirstier in the sandful breeze.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">She no more swept the house,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tended the fowls or cows,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fetch\u2019d honey, kneaded cakes of wheat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Brought water from the brook:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But sat down listless in the chimney-nook</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And would not eat.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Tender Lizzie could not bear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To watch her sister\u2019s cankerous care</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet not to share.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She night and morning</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Caught the goblins\u2019 cry:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cCome buy our orchard fruits,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come buy, come buy;\u201d\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beside the brook, along the glen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She heard the tramp of goblin men,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The yoke and stir</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Poor Laura could not hear;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long\u2019d to buy fruit to comfort her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But fear\u2019d to pay too dear.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She thought of Jeanie in her grave,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who should have been a bride;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But who for joys brides hope to have</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fell sick and died</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In her gay prime,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In earliest winter time</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With the first glazing rime,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With the first snow-fall of crisp winter time.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Till Laura dwindling</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seem\u2019d knocking at Death\u2019s door:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then Lizzie weigh\u2019d no more</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Better and worse;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But put a silver penny in her purse,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Kiss\u2019d Laura, cross\u2019d the heath with clumps of furze</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At twilight, halted by the brook:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And for the first time in her life</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Began to listen and look.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Laugh\u2019d every goblin</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When they spied her peeping:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came towards her hobbling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flying, running, leaping,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Puffing and blowing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Chuckling, clapping, crowing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clucking and gobbling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mopping and mowing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Full of airs and graces,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pulling wry faces,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Demure grimaces,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cat-like and rat-like,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ratel- and wombat-like,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Snail-paced in a hurry,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Parrot-voiced and whistler,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Helter skelter, hurry skurry,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Chattering like magpies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fluttering like pigeons,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gliding like fishes,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hugg\u2019d her and kiss\u2019d her:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Squeez\u2019d and caress\u2019d her:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stretch\u2019d up their dishes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Panniers, and plates:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cLook at our apples</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Russet and dun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bob at our cherries,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bite at our peaches,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Citrons and dates,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grapes for the asking,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pears red with basking</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Out in the sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Plums on their twigs;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pluck them and suck them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pomegranates, figs.\u201d\u2014</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cGood folk,\u201d said Lizzie,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mindful of Jeanie:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cGive me much and many: \u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Held out her apron,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Toss\u2019d them her penny.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cNay, take a seat with us,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Honour and eat with us,\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They answer\u2019d grinning:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cOur feast is but beginning.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Night yet is early,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Warm and dew-pearly,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wakeful and starry:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such fruits as these</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No man can carry:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Half their bloom would fly,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Half their dew would dry,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Half their flavour would pass by.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sit down and feast with us,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Be welcome guest with us,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cheer you and rest with us.\u201d\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cThank you,\u201d said Lizzie: \u201cBut one waits</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At home alone for me:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So without further parleying,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If you will not sell me any</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of your fruits though much and many,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Give me back my silver penny</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I toss\u2019d you for a fee.\u201d\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They began to scratch their pates,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No longer wagging, purring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But visibly demurring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grunting and snarling.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One call\u2019d her proud,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cross-grain\u2019d, uncivil;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their tones wax\u2019d loud,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their looks were evil.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lashing their tails</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They trod and hustled her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Elbow\u2019d and jostled her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Claw\u2019d with their nails,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Barking, mewing, hissing, mocking,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tore her gown and soil\u2019d her stocking,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twitch\u2019d her hair out by the roots,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stamp\u2019d upon her tender feet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Held her hands and squeez\u2019d their fruits</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Against her mouth to make her eat.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">White and golden Lizzie stood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a lily in a flood,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a rock of blue-vein\u2019d stone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lash\u2019d by tides obstreperously,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a beacon left alone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In a hoary roaring sea,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sending up a golden fire,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a fruit-crown\u2019d orange-tree</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">White with blossoms honey-sweet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sore beset by wasp and bee,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a royal virgin town</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Topp\u2019d with gilded dome and spire</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close beleaguer\u2019d by a fleet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mad to tug her standard down.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">One may lead a horse to water,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twenty cannot make him drink.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though the goblins cuff\u2019d and caught her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Coax\u2019d and fought her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bullied and besought her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Scratch\u2019d her, pinch\u2019d her black as ink,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Kick\u2019d and knock\u2019d her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Maul\u2019d and mock\u2019d her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lizzie utter\u2019d not a word;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would not open lip from lip</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lest they should cram a mouthful in:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But laugh\u2019d in heart to feel the drip</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of juice that syrupp\u2019d all her face,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And lodg\u2019d in dimples of her chin,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And streak\u2019d her neck which quaked like curd.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At last the evil people,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Worn out by her resistance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flung back her penny, kick\u2019d their fruit</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Along whichever road they took,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not leaving root or stone or shoot;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some writh\u2019d into the ground,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some div\u2019d into the brook</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With ring and ripple,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some scudded on the gale without a sound,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some vanish\u2019d in the distance.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In a smart, ache, tingle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lizzie went her way;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knew not was it night or day;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sprang up the bank, tore thro\u2019 the furze,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Threaded copse and dingle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And heard her penny jingle</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bouncing in her purse,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Its bounce was music to her ear.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She ran and ran</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if she fear\u2019d some goblin man</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dogg\u2019d her with gibe or curse</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or something worse:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But not one goblin scurried after,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor was she prick\u2019d by fear;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The kind heart made her windy-paced</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That urged her home quite out of breath with haste</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And inward laughter.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">She cried, \u201cLaura,\u201d up the garden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cDid you miss me?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come and kiss me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Never mind my bruises,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hug me, kiss me, suck my juices</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Squeez\u2019d from goblin fruits for you,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Goblin pulp and goblin dew.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Eat me, drink me, love me;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laura, make much of me;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For your sake I have braved the glen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And had to do with goblin merchant men.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Laura started from her chair,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flung her arms up in the air,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clutch\u2019d her hair:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cLizzie, Lizzie, have you tasted</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For my sake the fruit forbidden?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Must your light like mine be hidden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Your young life like mine be wasted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Undone in mine undoing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And ruin\u2019d in my ruin,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thirsty, canker\u2019d, goblin-ridden?\u201d\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She clung about her sister,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d her:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tears once again</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Refresh\u2019d her shrunken eyes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dropping like rain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After long sultry drouth;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shaking with aguish fear, and pain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She kiss\u2019d and kiss\u2019d her with a hungry mouth.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Her lips began to scorch,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That juice was wormwood to her tongue,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She loath\u2019d the feast:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Writhing as one possess\u2019d she leap\u2019d and sung,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rent all her robe, and wrung</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her hands in lamentable haste,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And beat her breast.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her locks stream\u2019d like the torch</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Borne by a racer at full speed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or like the mane of horses in their flight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or like an eagle when she stems the light</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Straight toward the sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or like a caged thing freed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or like a flying flag when armies run.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Swift fire spread through her veins, knock\u2019d at her heart,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Met the fire smouldering there</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And overbore its lesser flame;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She gorged on bitterness without a name:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ah! fool, to choose such part</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of soul-consuming care!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sense fail\u2019d in the mortal strife:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the watch-tower of a town</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which an earthquake shatters down,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a lightning-stricken mast,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a wind-uprooted tree</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Spun about,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a foam-topp\u2019d waterspout</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cast down headlong in the sea,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She fell at last;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pleasure past and anguish past,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is it death or is it life?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Life out of death.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That night long Lizzie watch\u2019d by her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Counted her pulse\u2019s flagging stir,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Felt for her breath,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Held water to her lips, and cool\u2019d her face</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With tears and fanning leaves:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when the first birds chirp\u2019d about their eaves,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And early reapers plodded to the place</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of golden sheaves,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And dew-wet grass</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bow\u2019d in the morning winds so brisk to pass,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And new buds with new day</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Open\u2019d of cup-like lilies on the stream,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laura awoke as from a dream,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laugh\u2019d in the innocent old way,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hugg\u2019d Lizzie but not twice or thrice;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her gleaming locks show\u2019d not one thread of grey,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her breath was sweet as May</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And light danced in her eyes.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Days, weeks, months, years</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Afterwards, when both were wives</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With children of their own;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their mother-hearts beset with fears,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their lives bound up in tender lives;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laura would call the little ones</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And tell them of her early prime,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Those pleasant days long gone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of not-returning time:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would talk about the haunted glen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The wicked, quaint fruit-merchant men,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their fruits like honey to the throat</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But poison in the blood;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Men sell not such in any town):</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would tell them how her sister stood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In deadly peril to do her good,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And win the fiery antidote:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then joining hands to little hands</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would bid them cling together,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cFor there is no friend like a sister</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In calm or stormy weather;</span><br /><span
