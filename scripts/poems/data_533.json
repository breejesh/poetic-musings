Remember how the crickets came\nOut of their mother grass, like little kin,\nIn the pale nights, when your first imagery\nFound inklings of your bond to all that dust.\n\nVI.\nIf men at forty will be painting lakes\nThe ephemeral blues must merge for them in one,\nThe basic slate, the universal hue.\nThere is a substance in us that prevails.\nBut in our amours amorists discern\nSuch fluctuations that their scrivening\nIs breathless to attend each quirky turn.\nWhen amorists grow bald, then amours shrink\nInto the compass and curriculum\nOf introspective exiles, lecturing.\nIt is a theme for Hyacinth alone.\n\nVII.\nThe mules that angels ride come slowly down\nThe blazing passes, from beyond the sun.\nDescensions of their tinkling bells arrive.\nThese muleteers are dainty of their way.\nMeantime, centurions guffaw and beat\nTheir shrilling tankards on the table-boards.\nThis parable, in sense, amounts to this:\nThe honey of heaven may or may not come,\nBut that of earth both comes and goes at once.\nSuppose these couriers brought amid their train\nA damsel heightened by eternal bloom.\n\nVIII.\nLike a dull scholar, I behold, in love,\nAn ancient aspect touching a new mind.\nIt comes, it blooms, it bears its fruit and dies.\nThis trivial trope reveals a way of truth.\nOur bloom is gone. We are the fruit thereof.\nTwo golden gourds distended on our vines,\nInto the autumn weather, splashed with frost,\nDistorted by hale fatness, turned grotesque.\nWe hang like warty squashes, streaked and rayed,\nThe laughing sky will see the two of us\nWashed into rinds by rotting winter rains.\n\nIX.\nIn verses wild with motion, full of din,\nLoudened by cries, by clashes, quick and sure\nAs the deadly thought of men accomplishing\nTheir curious fates in war, come, celebrate\nThe faith of forty, ward of Cupido.\nMost venerable heart, the lustiest conceit\nIs not too lusty for your broadening.\nI quiz all sounds, all thoughts, all everything\nFor the music and manner of the paladins\nTo make oblation fit. Where shall I find\nBravura adequate to this great hymn?\n\nX.\nThe fops of fancy in their poems leave\nMemorabilia of the mystic spouts,\nSpontaneously watering their gritty soils.\nI am a yeoman, as such fellows go.\nI know no magic trees, no balmy boughs,\nNo silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits.\nBut, after all, I know a tree that bears\nA semblance to the thing I have in mind.\nIt stands gigantic, with a certain tip\nTo which all birds come sometime in their time.\nBut when they go that tip still tips the tree.\n\nXI.\nIf sex were all, then every trembling hand\nCould make us squeak, like dolls, the wished-for words.\nBut note the unconscionable treachery of fate,\nThat makes us weep, laugh, grunt and groan, and shout\nDoleful heroics, pinching gestures forth\nFrom madness or delight, without regard\nTo that first, foremost law. Anguishing hour!\nLast night, we sat beside a pool of pink,\nClippered with lilies scudding the bright chromes,\nKeen to the point of starlight, while a frog\nBoomed from his very belly odious chords.\n\nXII.\nA blue pigeon it is, that circles the blue sky,\nOn sidelong wing, around and round and round.\nA white pigeon it is, that flutters to the ground,\nGrown tired of flight. Like a dark rabbi, I\nObserved, when young, the nature of mankind,\nIn lordly study.

I will not lie still! \nThere is a brown road runs between the pines, \nAnd further on the purple woodlands lie, \nAnd still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; \nAnd I would walk the road and I would be \nDeep in the wooded shade and I would reach \nThe windy mountain tops that touch the clouds. \nMy eyes may follow but my feet are held. \nRecumbent as you others must I too \nSubmit? Be mimic of your movelessness \nWith pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? \nAnd if the many sayings of the wise \nTeach of submission I will not submit \nBut with a spirit all unreconciled \nFlash an unquenched defiance to the stars. \nBetter it is to walk, to run, to dance, \nBetter it is to laugh and leap and sing, \nTo know the open skies of dawn and night, \nTo move untrammel'd down the flaming noon, \nAnd I will clamour it through weary days \nKeeping the edge of deprivation sharp, \nNor with the pliant speaking on my lips \nOf resignation, sister to defeat. \nI'll not be patient. I will not lie still. \n\nAnd in ironic quietude who is \nThe despot of our days and lord of dust \nNeeds but, scarce heeding, wait to drop \nGrim casual comment on rebellion's end: \n<i>\"Yes; yes . . . Wilful and petulant but now \nAs dead and quiet as the other are.\" </i>\nAnd this each body and ghost of you hath heard \nThat in your graves do therefore lie so still. </pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Guarded Wound", "view_node": "/poem/guarded-wound", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/adelaide-crapsey\" hreflang=\"und\">Adelaide Crapsey</a>", "field_date_published": "1915", "body": " <pre>\nIf it \nWere lighter touch \nThan petal of flower resting \nOn grass, oh still too heavy it were, \nToo heavy! </pre>\n "}, {"title": "First Fig", "view_node": "/poem/first-fig", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/edna-st-vincent-millay\" hreflang=\"und\">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a>", "field_date_published": "1920", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">My candle burns at both ends;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 It will not last the night;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 It gives a lovely light!</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Babylon", "view_node": "/poem/babylon", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/robert-graves\" hreflang=\"und\">Robert Graves</a>", "field_date_published": "1918", "body": " <pre>\nThe child alone a poet is:\nSpring and Fairyland are his.\nTruth and Reason show but dim,\nAnd all's poetry with him.\nRhyme and music flow in plenty\nFor the lad of one-and-twenty,\nBut Spring for him is no more now\nThan daisies to a munching cow;\nJust a cheery pleasant season,\nDaisy buds to live at ease on.\nHe's forgotten how he smiled\nAnd shrieked at snowdrops when a child,\nOr wept one evening secretly\nFor April's glorious misery.\nWisdom made him old and wary\nBanishing the Lords of Faery.\nWisdom made a breach and battered\nBabylon to bits: she scattered\nTo the hedges and ditches\nAll our nursery gnomes and witches.\nLob and Puck, poor frantic elves,\nDrag their treasures from the shelves.\nJack the Giant-killer's gone,\nMother Goose and Oberon,\nBluebeard and King Solomon.\nRobin, and Red Riding Hood\nTake together to the wood,\nAnd Sir Galahad lies hid\nIn a cave with Captain Kidd.\nNone of all the magic hosts,\nNone remain but a few ghosts\nOf timorous heart, to linger on\nWeeping for lost Babylon.</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 533, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
