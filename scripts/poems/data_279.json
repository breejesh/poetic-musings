makes, at last, the Old and New World one!<br />Let all mankind rejoice! for time nor space<br />Shall check the progress of the human race!<br />Though Nature heaved the Continents apart,<br />She cast in one great mould the human heart;<br />She framed on one great plan the human mind<br />And gave man speech to link him to his kind;<br />So that, though plains and mountains intervene,<br />Or oceans, broad and stormy, roll between,<br />If there but be a courier for the thought\u2014<br />Swift-winged or slow\u2014the land and seas are nought,<br />And man is nearer to his brother brought.<br /><br />First, ere the dawn of letters was, or burst<br />The light of science on the world, men, nurs\u2019t<br />In distant solitudes apart, did send,<br />Their skin-clad heralds forth to thread the woods,<br />Scale mountain-peaks, or swim the sudden floods,<br />And bear their messages of peace or war.<br /><br />Next, beasts were tamed to drag the rolling car,<br />Or speed the mounted rider on his track;<br />And then came, too, the vessels, oar-propelled,<br />Which fled the ocean, as the clouds grew black,<br />And safe near shore their prudent courses held.<br />Next came the winged ships, which, brave and free,<br />Did skim the bosom of the bounding sea,<br />And dared the storms and darkness in their flight,<br />Yet drifted far before the winds and night,<br />Or lay within the dead calm\u2019s grasp of might.<br />Then, sea-divided nations nearer came,<br />Stood face to face, spake each the other\u2019s name,<br />In friendship grew, and learned the truth sublime,<br />That Man is Man in every age and clime!<br />They nearer were by months and years\u2014but space<br />Must still be shortened in Improvement\u2019s race,<br />And steam came next to wake the world from sleep,<br />And launch her black-plumed warriors of the deep;<br />The which, in calm or storm, rode onward still,<br />And braved the raging elements at will.<br />Then distance, which from calms\u2019 and storms\u2019 delays<br />Grew into months, was shortened into days,<br />And Science\u2019 self declared her wildest dream<br />Reached not beyond this miracle of steam!<br />But steam hath not the lightning\u2019s wondrous power,<br />Though, Titan-like, mid Science\u2019 sons it tower<br />And wrestle with the ocean in his wrath,<br />And sweep the wild waves foaming from its path.<br />A mightier monarch is that subtler thing,<br />Which gives to human thought a thought-swift wing;<br />Which speaks in thunder like a God,<br />Or humbly stoops to kiss the lifted rod;<br />Ascends to Night\u2019s dim, solitary throne,<br />And clothes it with a splendor not its own\u2014<br />A ghastly grandeur and a ghostly sheen,<br />Through which the pale stars tremble as they\u2019re seen;<br />Descends to fire the far horizon\u2019s rim,<br />And paints Mount Etnas in the cloudland grim;<br />Or, proud to own fair Science\u2019 rightful sway,<br />Low bends along th\u2019 electric wire to play,<br />And, helping out the ever-wondrous plan,<br />Becomes, in sooth, an errand-boy for man!<br /><br />This Power it was, which, not content with aught<br />As yet achieved by human will or thought,<br />Disdained the slow account of months or days,<br />In navigation of the ocean ways,<br />And days would shorten into hours, and these<br />To minutes, in the face of sounding seas.<br />If Thought might not be borne upon the foam<br />Of furrowing keel, with speed that Thought should roam,<br />It then should walk, like light, the ocean\u2019s bed,<br />And laugh to scorn the winds and waves o\u2019er head!<br />Beneath the reach of storm or wreck, down where<br />The skeletons of men and navies are,<br />Its silent steps should be; while o\u2019er its path<br />The monsters of the deep, in sport or wrath,<br />The waters lashed, till like a pot should boil<br />The sea, and fierce Arion seize the upcast spoil.<br /><br />America! to thee belongs the praise<br />Of this great crowning deed of modern days.<br />\u2019T was Franklin called the wonder from on high;<br />\u2019T was Morse who bade it on man\u2019s errands fly\u2014<br />\u2019T was he foretold its pathway \u2019neath the sea:<br />A daring Field fulfilled the prophecy!<br />\u2019T was fitting that a great, free land like this,<br />Should give the lightning\u2019s voice to Liberty;<br />Should wing the heralds of Earth\u2019s happiness,<br />And sing, beneath the ever-sounding sea,<br />The fair, the bright millennial days to be.<br /><br />Now may, ere long, the sword be sheathed to rust,<br />The helmet laid in undistinguished dust;<br />The thund\u2019rous chariot pause in mid career,<br />Its crimsoned wheels no more through blood to steer;<br />The red-hoofed steed from fields of death be led,<br />Or turned to pasture where the armies bled;<br />For Nation unto Nation soon shall be<br />Together brought in knitted unity,<br />And man be bound to man by that strong chain,<br />Which, linking land to land, and main to main,<br />Shall vibrate to the voice of Peace, and be<br />A throbbing heartstring of Humanity!</p><br clear=\"all\" />"},
