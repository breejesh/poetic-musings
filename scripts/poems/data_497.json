  \n        None but the brave   \n        None but the brave   \n  None but the brave deserves the fair! \n   \n    Timotheus placed on high   \n        Amid the tuneful quire   \nWith flying fingers touch'd the lyre:   \n    The trembling notes ascend the sky   \n        And heavenly joys inspire. \nThe song began from Jove   \nWho left his blissful seats above   \nSuch is the power of mighty love!   \n    A dragon's fiery form belied the god;   \n    Sublime on radiant spires he rode \n    When he to fair Olympia prest,   \n    And while he sought her snowy breast,   \n  Then round her slender waist he curl'd,   \nAnd stamp'd an image of himself, a sovereign of the world.   \n  The listening crowd admire the lofty sound; \n  A present deity! they shout around:   \n  A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound:   \n        With ravish'd ears   \n        The monarch hears,   \n        Assumes the god; \n        Affects to nod,  \n    And seems to shake the spheres.   \n   \nThe praise of Bacchus then the sweet musician sung,   \n    Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young:   \n        The jolly god in triumph comes; \n        Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!   \n            Flush'd with a purple grace   \n            He shows his honest face:   \nNow give the hautboys breath; he comes, he comes!   \n    Bacchus, ever fair and young, \n        Drinking joys did first ordain;   \n    Bacchus' blessings are a treasure,   \n    Drinking is the soldier's pleasure:   \n        Rich the treasure,   \n        Sweet the pleasure, \n    Sweet is pleasure after pain.   \n   \n    Soothed with the sound, the king grew vain;   \n        Fought all his battles o'er again,   \nAnd thrice he routed all his foes, and thrice he slew the slain!   \n    The master saw the madness rise, \n    His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes;   \n    And while he Heaven and Earth defied   \n    Changed his hand and check'd his pride.   \n        He chose a mournful Muse   \n        Soft pity to infuse: \n    He sung Darius great and good,   \n        By too severe a fate   \n    Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,   \n        Fallen from his high estate.   \n    And weltering in his blood; \n    Deserted at his utmost need   \n    By those his former bounty fed;   \n    On the bare earth exposed he lies   \n    With not a friend to close his eyes.   \nWith downcast looks the joyless victor sate, \n        Revolving in his alter'd soul   \n            The various turns of chance below;   \n        And now and then a sigh he stole,   \n            And tears began to flow.   \n   \n    The mighty master smiled to see  \n    That love was in the next degree;   \n    'Twas but a kindred sound to move,   \n    For pity melts the mind to love.   \n        Softly sweet, in Lydian measures   \n        Soon he soothed his soul to pleasures. \n    War, he sung, is toil and trouble,   \n    Honour but an empty bubble;   \n        Never ending, still beginning,   \n    Fighting still, and still destroying;   \n        If the world be worth thy winning, \n    Think, O think, it worth enjoying:   \n        Lovely Thais sits beside thee,   \n    Take the good the gods provide thee!   \nThe many rend the skies with loud applause;   \nSo Love was crown'd, but Music won the cause.  \n    The prince, unable to conceal his pain,   \n            Gazed on the fair   \n            Who caused his care,   \n    And sigh'd and look'd, sigh'd and look'd,   \n    Sigh'd and look'd, and sigh'd again:   \n  At length with love and wine at once opprest   \n  The vanquish'd victor sunk upon her breast.   \n   \nNow strike the golden lyre again:   \nA louder yet, and yet a louder strain!   \nBreak his bands of sleep asunder \nAnd rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder.   \n        Hark, hark! the horrid sound   \n            Has raised up his head:   \n            As awaked from the dead   \n        And amazed he stares around. \n    Revenge, revenge, Timotheus cries,   \n        See the Furies arise!   \n        See the snakes that they rear   \n        How they hiss in their hair,   \n    And the sparkles that flash from their eyes! \n        Behold a ghastly band,   \n        Each a torch in his hand!   \n  Those are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain   \n            And unburied remain   \n            Inglorious on the plain: \n            Give the vengeance due   \n            To the valiant crew!   \n  Behold how they toss their torches on high,   \n      How they point to the Persian abodes   \n  And glittering temples of their hostile gods. \n  The princes applaud with a furious joy:   \n  And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy;   \n        Thais led the way   \n        To light him to his prey,   \n  And like another Helen, fired another Troy! \n   \n            Thus, long ago,   \n    Ere heaving bellows learn'd to blow,   \n        While organs yet were mute,   \n        Timotheus, to his breathing flute   \n            And sounding lyre \nCould swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire.   \n    At last divine Cecilia came.   \n    Inventress of the vocal frame;   \nThe sweet enthusiast from her sacred store   \n    Enlarged the former narrow bounds, \n    And added length to solemn sounds,   \nWith Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.   \n    Let old Timotheus yield the prize,   \n        Or both divide the crown;   \n    He raised a mortal to the skies, \n        She drew an angel down!</pre>\n "}, {"title": "From an Italian Postcard Factory (audio only)", "view_node": "/poem/italian-postcard-factory-audio-only", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/margaret-atwood\" hreflang=\"und\">Margaret Atwood</a>", "field_date_published": "1978", "body": " <p>\u00a0</p><p>Click the icon above to listen to this audio poem.</p> "}, {"title": "My Mother&#039;s Lips (audio only)", "view_node": "/poem/my-mothers-lips-audio-only", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/c-k-williams\" hreflang=\"und\">C.
