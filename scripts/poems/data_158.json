We must not grudge, then, to others</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ever the cup of cold water, or crumbs that fall from our table.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus rebuked, for a season was silent the penitent housemaid;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Elizabeth said in tones even sweeter and softer:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cDost thou remember, Hannah, the great May-Meeting in London,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When I was still a child, how we sat in the silent assembly,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waiting upon the Lord in patient and passive submission?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No one spake, till at length a young man, a stranger, John Estaugh,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Moved by the Spirit, rose, as if he were John the Apostle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speaking such words of power that they bowed our hearts, as a strong wind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bends the grass of the fields, or grain that is ripe for the sickle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thoughts of him to-day have been oft borne inward upon me,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wherefore I do not know; but strong is the feeling within me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That once more I shall see a face I have never forgotten.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">II</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">E\u2019en as she spake they heard the musical jangle of sleigh-bells,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">First far off, with a dreamy sound and faint in the distance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then growing nearer and louder, and turning into the farmyard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till it stopped at the door, with sudden creaking of runners.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then there were voices heard as of two men talking together,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And to herself, as she listened, upbraiding said Hannah the housemaid,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cIt is Joseph come back, and I wonder what stranger is with him?\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Down from its nail she took and lighted the great tin lantern</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pierced with holes, and round, and roofed like the top of a lighthouse,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And went forth to receive the coming guest at the doorway,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Casting into the dark a network of glimmer and shadow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over the falling snow, the yellow sleigh, and the horses,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the forms of men, snow-covered, looming gigantic.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then giving Joseph the lantern, she entered the house with the stranger.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Youthful he was and tall, and his cheeks aglow with the night air;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as he entered, Elizabeth rose, and, going to meet him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if an unseen power had announced and preceded his presence,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And he had come as one whose coming had long been expected,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Quietly gave him her hand, and said, \u201dThou art welcome, John Estaugh.\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the stranger replied, with staid and quiet behavior,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cDost thou remember me still, Elizabeth? After so many</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Years have passed, it seemeth a wonderful thing that I find thee.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Surely the hand of the Lord conducted me here to thy threshold.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For as I journeyed along, and pondered alone and in silence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On his ways, that are past finding out, I saw in the snow-mist,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemingly weary with travel, a wayfarer, who by the wayside</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Paused and waited. Forthwith I remembered Queen Candace\u2019s eunuch,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How on the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Reading Esaias the Prophet, he journeyed, and spake unto Philip,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Praying him to come up and sit in his chariot with him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I greeted the man, and he mounted the sledge beside me,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as we talked on the way he told me of thee and thy homestead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How, being led by the light of the Spirit, that never deceiveth,</span><br />\nFull of zeal for the work of the Lord, thou hadst come to this country.<br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I remembered thy name, and thy father and mother in England,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And on my journey have stopped to see thee, Elizabeth Haddon.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wishing to strengthen thy hand in the labors of love thou art doing.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And Elizabeth answered with confident voice, and serenely</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Looking into his face with her innocent eyes as she answered,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cSurely the hand of the Lord is in it; his Spirit hath led thee</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Out of the darkness and storm to the light and peace of my fireside.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then, with stamping of feet, the door was opened, and Joseph</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Entered, bearing the lantern, and, carefully blowing the light out,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hung it up on its nail, and all sat down to their supper;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For underneath that roof was no distinction of persons,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But one family only, one heart, one hearth and one household.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">When the supper was ended they drew their chairs to the fireplace,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Spacious, open-hearted, profuse of flame and of firewood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lord of forests unfelled, and not a gleaner of fagots,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Spreading its arms to embrace with inexhaustible bounty</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All who fled from the cold, exultant, laughing at winter!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only Hannah the housemaid was busy in clearing the table,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Coming and going, and hustling about in closet and chamber.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then Elizabeth told her story again to John Estaugh,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Going far back to the past, to the early days of her childhood;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How she had waited and watched, in all her doubts and besetments</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Comforted with the extendings and holy, sweet inflowings</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the spirit of love, till the voice imperative sounded,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And she obeyed the voice, and cast in her lot with her people</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here in the desert land, and God would provide for the issue.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile Joseph sat with folded hands, and demurely</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Listened, or seemed to listen, and in the silence that followed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nothing was heard for a while but the step of Hannah the housemaid</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Walking the floor overhead, and setting the chambers in order.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Elizabeth said, with a smile of compassion, \u201dThe maiden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hath a light heart in her breast, but her feet are heavy and awkward.\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Inwardly Joseph laughed, but governed his tongue, and was silent.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then came the hour of sleep, death\u2019s counterfeit, nightly rehearsal</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the great Silent Assembly, the Meeting of shadows, where no man </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speaketh, but all are still, and the peace and rest are unbroken!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silently over that house the blessing of slumber descended.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when the morning dawned, and the sun uprose in his splendor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Breaking his way through clouds that encumbered his path in the heavens,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Joseph was seen with his sled and oxen breaking a pathway</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through the drifts of snow; the horses already were harnessed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And John Estaugh was standing and taking leave at the threshold,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saying that he should return at the Meeting in May; while above</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">them Hannah the housemaid, the homely, was looking out of the attic,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laughing aloud at Joseph, then suddenly closing the casement,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As the bird in a cuckoo-clock peeps out of its window,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then disappears again, and closes the shutter behind it.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">III</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Now was the winter gone, and the snow; and Robin the Redbreast</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Boasted on bush and tree it was he, it was he and no other</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That had covered with leaves the Babes in the Wood, and blithely</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the birds sang with him, and little cared for his boasting,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or for his Babes in the Wood, or the Cruel Uncle, and only</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sang for the mates they had chosen, and cared for the nests they were building.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With them, but more sedately and meekly, Elizabeth Haddon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sang in her inmost heart, but her lips were silent and songless.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus came the lovely spring with a rush of blossoms and music,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flooding the earth with flowers, and the air with melodies vernal.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then it came to pass, one pleasant morning, that slowly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Up the road there came a cavalcade, as of pilgrims</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Men and women, wending their way to the Quarterly Meeting</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the neighboring town; and with them came riding John Estaugh.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At Elizabeth\u2019s door they stopped to rest, and alighting</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tasted the currant wine, and the bread of rye, and the honey</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Brought from the hives, that stood by the sunny wall of the garden;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then remounted their horses, refreshed, and continued their journey,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Elizabeth with them, and Joseph, and Hannah the housemaid.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But, as they started, Elizabeth lingered a little, and leaning</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over her horse\u2019s neck, in a whisper said to John Estaugh</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cTarry awhile behind, for I have something to tell thee,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not to be spoken lightly, nor in the presence of others;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Them it concerneth not, only thee and me it concerneth.\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And they rode slowly along through the woods, conversing together.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was a pleasure to breathe the fragrant air of the forest;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was a pleasure to live on that bright and happy May morning!</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then Elizabeth said, though still with a certain reluctance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if impelled to reveal a secret she fain would have guarded:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cI will no longer conceal what is laid upon me to tell thee;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I have received from the Lord a charge to love thee, John Estaugh.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And John Estaugh made answer, surprised by the words she had spoken,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cPleasant to me are thy converse, thy ways, thy meekness of spirit;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pleasant thy frankness of speech, and thy soul\u2019s immaculate whiteness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Love without dissimulation, a holy and inward adorning.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I have yet no light to lead me, no voice to direct me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the Lord\u2019s work is done, and the toil and the labor completed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He hath appointed to me, I will gather into the stillness</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of my own heart awhile, and listen and wait for his guidance.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then Elizabeth said, not troubled nor wounded in spirit,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cSo is it best, John Estaugh. We will not speak of it further.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It hath been laid upon me to tell thee this, for to-morrow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thou art going away, across the sea, and I know not</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When I shall see thee more; but if the Lord hath decreed it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thou wilt return again to seek me here and to find me.\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And they rode onward in silence, and entered the town with the others.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">IV</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Ships that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Now went on as of old the quiet life of the homestead.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Patient and unrepining Elizabeth labored, in all things</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mindful not of herself, but bearing the burdens of others,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Always thoughtful and kind and untroubled; and Hannah the housemaid</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Diligent early and late, and rosy with washing and scouring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still as of old disparaged the eminent merits of Joseph,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And was at times reproved for her light and frothy behavior,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For her shy looks, and her careless words, and her evil surmisings,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Being pressed down somewhat like a cart with sheaves overladen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As she would sometimes say to Joseph, quoting the Scriptures.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile John Estaugh departed across the sea, and departing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Carried hid in his heart a secret sacred and precious,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filling its chambers with fragrance, and seeming to him in its sweetness</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mary\u2019s ointment of spikenard, that filled all the house with its odor.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">O lost days of delight, that are wasted in doubting and waiting!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">O lost hours and days in which we might have been happy!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the light shone at last, and guided his wavering footsteps,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And at last came the voice, imperative, questionless, certain.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then John Estaugh came back o\u2019er the sea for the gift that was offered,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Better than houses and lands, the gift of a woman\u2019s affection.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And on the First-Day that followed, he rose in the Silent Assembly,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Holding in his strong hand a hand that trembled a little,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Promising to be kind and true and faithful in all things.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such were the marriage rites of John and Elizabeth Estaugh.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And not otherwise Joseph, the honest, the diligent servant,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sped in his bashful wooing with homely Hannah the housemaid;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For when he asked her the question, she answered, \u201dNay\u201d; and then added</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cBut thee may make believe, and see what will come of it, Joseph.\u201d</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Second Law", "view_node": "/poem/second-law", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/samiya-bashir\" hreflang=\"en\">Samiya Bashir</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Who was warned about these things:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the neverhush, the maddening chafe</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sliding down a reddened bridge, print</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">disappearing \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 disappearing?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Who was told how to brook it?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The houndstooth stench of olding.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That time just runs itself out.

/>\nAll within him and without him<br />\nIn that narrow cell of stone;<br />\nAnd he saw the Blessed Vision<br />\nOf our Lord, with light Elysian<br />\nLike a vesture wrapped about him,<br />\nLike a garment round him thrown.</p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Not as crucified and slain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not in agonies of pain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not with bleeding hands and feet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Did the Monk his Master see;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But as in the village street,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the house or harvest-field,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Halt and lame and blind he healed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he walked in Galilee.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In an attitude imploring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hands upon his bosom crossed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wondering, worshipping, adoring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knelt the Monk in rapture lost.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who am I, that thus thou deignest</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To reveal thyself to me?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who am I, that from the centre</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of thy glory thou shouldst enter</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This poor cell, my guest to be?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then amid his exaltation,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Loud the convent bell appalling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From its belfry calling, calling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rang through court and corridor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With persistent iteration</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He had never heard before.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was now the appointed hour</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When alike in shine or shower,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Winter\u2019s cold or summer's heat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the convent portals came</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the blind and halt and lame,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the beggars of the street,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For their daily dole of food</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dealt them by the brotherhood;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And their almoner was he</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who upon his bended knee,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rapt in silent ecstasy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of divinest self-surrender,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saw the Vision and the Splendor.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Deep distress and hesitation</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mingled with his adoration;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Should he go, or should he stay?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Should he leave the poor to wait</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hungry at the convent gate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till the Vision passed away?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Should he slight his radiant guest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slight this visitant celestial,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For a crowd of ragged, bestial</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beggars at the convent gate?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would the Vision there remain?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would the Vision come again?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then a voice within his breast</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whispered, audible and clear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if to the outward ear:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cDo thy duty; that is best;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Leave unto thy Lord the rest!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Straightway to his feet he started,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with longing look intent</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the Blessed Vision bent,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly from his cell departed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly on his errand went.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">At the gate the poor were waiting,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Looking through the iron grating,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With that terror in the eye</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That is only seen in those</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who amid their wants and woes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hear the sound of doors that close,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And of feet that pass them by;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grown familiar with disfavor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grown familiar with the savor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the bread by which men die!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But to-day, they knew not why,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the gate of Paradise</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed the convent gate to rise,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a sacrament divine</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed to them the bread and wine.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In his heart the Monk was praying,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thinking of the homeless poor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What they suffer and endure;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What we see not, what we see;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the inward voice was saying:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cWhatsoever thing thou doest</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the least of mine and lowest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That thou doest unto me!\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Unto me! but had the Vision</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come to him in beggar\u2019s clothing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come a mendicant imploring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would he then have knelt adoring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or have listened with derision,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And have turned away with loathing?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus his conscience put the question,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Full of troublesome suggestion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As at length, with hurried pace,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Towards his cell he turned his face,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And beheld the convent bright</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With a supernatural light,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a luminous cloud expanding</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over floor and wall and ceiling.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But he paused with awe-struck feeling</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At the threshold of his door,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the Vision still was standing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As he left it there before,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the convent bell appalling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From its belfry calling, calling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Summoned him to feed the poor.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through the long hour intervening</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It had waited his return,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And he felt his bosom burn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Comprehending all the meaning,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the Blessed Vision said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cHadst thou stayed, I must
