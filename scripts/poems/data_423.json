In the juvescence of the year\t\nCame Christ the tiger\n \nIn depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering judas,\t\nTo be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk\t\nAmong whispers; by Mr. Silvero\t\nWith caressing hands, at Limoges\t\nWho walked all night in the next room;\nBy Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians;\t\nBy Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room\t\nShifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp\t\nWho turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles\t\nWeave the wind. I have no ghosts,\nAn old man in a draughty house\t\nUnder a windy knob.\t\n \nAfter such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now\t\nHistory has many cunning passages, contrived corridors\t\nAnd issues, deceives with whispering ambitions,\nGuides us by vanities. Think now\t\nShe gives when our attention is distracted\t\nAnd what she gives, gives with such supple confusions\t\nThat the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late\t\nWhat\u2019s not believed in, or if still believed,\nIn memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon\t\nInto weak hands, what\u2019s thought can be dispensed with\t\nTill the refusal propagates a fear. Think\t\nNeither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices\t\nAre fathered by our heroism. Virtues\nAre forced upon us by our impudent crimes.\t\nThese tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree.\t\n \nThe tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last\t\nWe have not reached conclusion, when I\t\nStiffen in a rented house. Think at last\nI have not made this show purposelessly\t\nAnd it is not by any concitation\t\nOf the backward devils\t\nI would meet you upon this honestly.\t\nI that was near your heart was removed therefrom\nTo lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition.\t\nI have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it\t\nSince what is kept must be adulterated?\t\nI have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch:\t\nHow should I use it for your closer contact?\n \nThese with a thousand small deliberations\t\nProtract the profit of their chilled delirium,\t\nExcite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,\t\nWith pungent sauces, multiply variety\t\nIn a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,\nSuspend its operations, will the weevil\t\nDelay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled\t\nBeyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear\t\nIn fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits\t\nOf Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,\nWhite feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,\t\nAnd an old man driven by the Trades\t\nTo a a sleepy corner.\t\n \n                    Tenants of the house,\t\nThoughts of a dry brain in a dry season.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Boston Evening Transcript", "view_node": "/poem/boston-evening-transcript", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/t-s-eliot\" hreflang=\"und\">T.
