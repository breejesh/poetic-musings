Between the limbs and wings,<br />bleached street-lit things, I\u2019m best at moving on.<br />Hunt-heavy, gray, slunk overlow like so<br />much weight got in the way, my shape\u2019s the shape<br />of something missed, flash-pop or empty frame.<br />Though you could say I\u2019ve made a game of this,<br />and though midtrickery it might be true,<br />when evening lingers in the key of leaving<br />my senses swoon. A synonym for stay,<br />I\u2019m always coming back. I chew through traps.<br />I love whatever doesn\u2019t get too close.</p> "}, {"title": "Ghosts on the Road", "view_node": "/poem/ghosts-road", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/david-rivard\" hreflang=\"und\">David Rivard</a>", "field_date_published": "2015", "body": " <p>A bookkeeping man,<br />tho one sure to knock on wood,<br />and mostly light</p><p>at loose ends\u2014my friend<br />who is superstitiously funny, &amp; always<br />sarcastic\u2014save once,</p><p>after I\u2019d told him<br />about Simone\u2019s first time<br />walking\u2014a toddler,</p><p>almost alone, she\u2019d<br />gripped her sweater, right hand<br />clutched</p><p>chest-high, reassured<br />then, she held on to herself<br />so, so took a few</p><p>quick steps\u2014<br />oh, he said, you know what?
