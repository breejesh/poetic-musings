Each morning I sit on the edge of the bed with my feet planted on the unlovely linoleum floor and I say slowly but quite distinctly to the darkness, \"Sweet joy befall thee.\" I feel like an actor speaking the first words of a play except my life is no play nor does my soul need an audience. What I do need is confidence. I've built my life up from very shaky ground and William Blake, the man who wrote that line, has been a godsend to me. The human voice that speaks a poem rises from a powerful well; we take it for granted but a voice is an advent of spirit. I know from attending numerous churches during my haphazard childhood that the joy that preachers trumpet comes in a box with grievous dimensions. Their salvation is a machine of wrath; they break your back on hell so you can get to heaven. The joy I invoke can go where it chooses because it resides in our being alive. The joy I invoke is Blake's Jerusalem, the city we can build each day through kindness: \"The most sublime act is to set another before you.\" No one has ever called the place where I work \"sublime,\" so I need that word, too.</p> "}, {"title": "To My Mother Waiting on 10/01/54", "view_node": "/poem/my-mother-waiting-100154", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/teresa-carson\" hreflang=\"und\">Teresa Carson</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <pre>\nThat October might have begun\npretty much like this one.
