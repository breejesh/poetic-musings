in this they bath'd their feet,\nAnd after with clean towels dry'd their sweat:\nThis done, the host produc'd the genial bed,\nSallow the feet, the borders, and the sted,\nWhich with no costly coverlet they spread;\nBut coarse old garments, yet such robes as these\nThey laid alone, at feasts, on holydays.\nThe good old huswife tucking up her gown,\nThe table sets; th' invited gods lie down.\nThe trivet-table of a foot was lame,\nA blot which prudent Baucis overcame,\nWho thrusts beneath the limping leg, a sherd,\nSo was the mended board exactly rear'd:\nThen rubb'd it o'er with newly-gather'd mint,\nA wholesome herb, that breath'd a grateful scent.\nPallas began the feast, where first were seen\nThe party-colour'd olive, black and green:\nAutumnal cornels next in order serv'd,\nIn lees of wine well pickl'd, and preserv'd:\nA garden-salad was the third supply,\nOf endive, radishes, and succory:\nThen curds and cream, the flow'r of country-fare,\nAnd new-laid eggs, which Baucis' busy care\nTurn'd by a gentle fire, and roasted rear.\nAll these in earthen ware were serv'd to board;\nAnd next in place, an earthen pitcher, stor'd\nWith liquor of the best the cottage cou'd afford.\nThis was the table's ornament and pride,\nWith figures wrought: like pages at his side\nStood beechen bowls; and these were shining clean,\nVarnish'd with wax without, and lin'd within.\nBy this the boiling kettle had prepar'd,\nAnd to the table sent the smoking lard;\nOn which with eager appetite they dine,\nA sav'ry bit, that serv'd to relish wine:\nThe wine itself was suiting to the rest,\nStill working in the must, and lately press'd.\nThe second course succeeds like that before,\nPlums, apples, nuts, and of their wintry store,\nDry figs, and grapes, and wrinkl'd dates were set\nIn canisters, t' enlarge the little treat\nAll these a milk-white honey-comb surround,\nWhich in the midst the country banquet crown'd:\nBut the kind hosts their entertainment grace\nWith hearty welcome, and an open face:\nIn all they did, you might discern with ease,\nA willing mind, and a desire to please. \n   Meantime the beechen bowls went round, and still,\nThough often empty'd, were observ'd to fill;\nFill'd without hands, and of their own accord\nRan without feet, and danc'd about the board.\nDevotion seiz'd the pair, to see the feast\nWith wine, and of no common grape, increas'd;\nAnd up they held their hands, and fell to pray'r,\nExcusing, as they cou'd, their country fare. \n    One goose they had, ('twas all they cou'd allow)\nA wakeful sent'ry, and on duty now,\nWhom to the gods for sacrifice they vow:\nHer, with malicious zeal, the couple view'd;\nShe ran for life, and limping they pursu'd:\nFull well the fowl perceiv'd their bad intent,\nAnd wou'd not make her masters compliment;\nBut persecuted, to the pow'rs she flies,\nAnd close between the legs of Love she lies.\nHe with a gracious ear the suppliant heard,\nAnd sav'd her life; then what he was declar'd,\nAnd own'd the god. 'The neighbourhood,' said he,\n'Shall justly perish for impiety:\nYou stand alone exempted; but obey\nWith speed, and follow where we lead the way:\nLeave these accurs'd; and to the mountain's height\nAscend; nor once look backward in your flight.'\n   They haste, and what their tardy feet deny'd,\nThe trusty staff (their better leg) supply'd.\nAn arrow's flight they wanted to the top,\nAnd there secure, but spent with travel, stop;\nThen turn their now no more forbidden eyes;\nLost in a lake the floated level lies:\nA watry desert covers all the plains,\nTheir cot alone, as in an isle, remains:\nWondring with weeping eyes, while they deplore\nTheir neighbours' fate, and country now no more,\nTheir little shed, scarce large enough for two,\nSeems, from the ground increas'd, in height and bulk to grow.\nA stately temple shoots within the skies:\nThe crotches of their cot in columns rise:\nThe pavement polish'd marble they behold,\nThe gates with sculpture grac'd, the spires and tiles of gold. \n    Then thus the sire of gods, with look serene,\n'Speak thy desire, thou only just of men;\nAnd thou, O woman, only worthy found\nTo be with such a man in marriage bound.'\n   A while they whisper; then, to Jove address'd,\nPhilemon thus prefers their joint request:\n'We crave to serve before your sacred shrine,\nAnd offer at your altars rites divine:\nAnd since not any action of our life\nHas been polluted with domestic strife,\nWe beg one hour of death; that neither she\nWith widow's tears may live to bury me,\nNor weeping I, with wither'd arms may bear\nMy breathless Baucis to the sepulcher.'\n   The godheads sign their suit. They run their race\nIn the same tenor all th' appointed space;\nThen, when their hour was come, while they relate\nThese past adventures at the temple-gate,\nOld Baucis is by old Philemon seen\nSprouting with sudden leaves of spritely green:\nOld Baucis look'd where old Philemon stood,\nAnd saw his lengthen'd arms a sprouting wood:\nNew roots their fasten'd feet begin to bind,\nTheir bodies stiffen in a rising rind:\nThen e'er the bark above their shoulders grew,\nThey give and take at once their last adieu;\nAt once, farewell, O faithful spouse, they said;\nAt once th' incroaching rinds their closing lips invade.\nEv'n yet, an ancient Tyanaean shows\nA spreading oak, that near a linden grows:\nThe neighbourhood confirm the prodigie,\nGrave men, not vain of tongue, or like to lie.\nI saw myself the garlands on their boughs,\nAnd tablets hung for gifts of granted vows;\nAnd off'ring fresher up, with pious pray'r,\nThe good, said I, are God's peculiar care,\nAnd such as honour heav'n, shall heav'nly honour share.\"\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Anactoria Poem", "view_node": "/poem/anactoria-poem", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/sappho\" hreflang=\"und\">Sappho</a>", "field_date_published": "2007", "body": " <pre>Some say thronging cavalry, some say foot soldiers, \nothers call a fleet the most beautiful of \nsights the dark earth offers, but I say it's what-\n            ever you love best.\n\nAnd it's easy to make this understood by \neveryone, for she who surpassed all human \nkind in beauty, Helen, abandoning her\n            husband\u2014that best of\n\nmen\u2014went sailing off to the shores of Troy and \nnever spent a thought on her child or loving \nparents: when the goddess seduced her wits and\n            left her to wander,\n\nshe forgot them all, she could not remember \nanything but longing, and lightly straying \naside, lost her way.
