But here on the boat, at anchor,\napart from the ordinary lull of the easy\ntide, there is a certain peace. \n \nHe cannot know that in six months \nthe weight of locked wool on his shoulders \nwill be lifted, that in the soft gloom of a German \nchalet in deep January he will anticipate with terror \nhis death, rewriting his theology of eternity, shadowed\nby the swirling clouds, the bickering sycophants,\nthe friends who will not stop to pray, frightened \nas they are by the end of the crusade, the last \ntriumphant march through the world\u2019s plaza where\nthe faithful Milanese, one hundred thousand strong,\nstand beatific under the benediction of brutalizing music.\n \nAnd here he already knows that his last songs\nconvey the weight of a man sitting on the sea,\nstaring out into the slithering metallic green \nand imagining his words as prayers. \n \nThis is the burden a poet must carry with him \nto the sea, the burden for a truth unfettered \nby the promise of another morning. The sea\nis a continuous tomorrow, so unremarkable\nthat it becomes an exquisite now: \nwhat a lofty standard of truth it is for a poem.\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Redacted from a Know-Your-Rights Training Agenda\u2014", "view_node": "/poem/redacted-know-your-rights-training-agenda", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/cynthia-dewi-oka\" hreflang=\"en\">Cynthia Dewi Oka</a>", "field_date_published": "2018", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">That a potholed street in the middling borough of Collingswood, New Jersey, bears the name Atlantic, after an all-consuming body of water.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That all-consuming is Atlas\u2019 curse to bear the heavens on his shoulders.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That after the fall of the gods, half of the heavens is darkness.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That inside the car speeding down the street, I believe I am safe from being halved. </span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That \u201cI\u201d am not a white box, but a body of water.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That white is a pattern of boys who expect to live long enough to become men.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That some of these boys are whistling by on their bikes, and behind them, clear as a dream, welcome candles in the windows framed by blooms of vervain.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That \u201cwelcome\u201d means I thought I was not afraid of the dark.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since the jade scrubs of the cancer ward.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since the florescent grid of the factory and the vista of small bones in my father\u2019s collar while I was interpreting for the twenty-something-year-old white citizen,</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u201cTell your dad he can quit or I can fire him.\u201d</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grief had already burst its cocoon;
