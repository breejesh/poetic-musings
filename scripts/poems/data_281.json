Every evening</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for relentless hours, eyes reflecting moon\u2019s fullness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">yellow and prying, seep through every crack in the</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">roof and walls. In my mind this rogue is sleek and</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">wants to inject a language of advice into all the layers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of wood and knots. An amount, I fully suspect, of</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">gray split tongue heaviness, speaking undeniable,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">unchallenged but for sure on the level of new myths.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This ancient teller of old stories wants to bargain with</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">me. In exchange for the placement of a large winter</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">nest of retreat in my attic (no sticks, just debris,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">wire and tubing. No dried leaves, but used plastic</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sacks and old newspapers), he will tell his oldest</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">stories for the troubled times of the now. Stories kept</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">hidden like aged rocks that spark, breath and speak</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">when hit by flint knives, or live for a hot new fire to</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sooth, replenish. His approach is a slow march of</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">scaled skin and worn talons from clawing his way</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">through. My Dakota tongue knows his rasping songs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his pitiful stories. Always perched up high, almost</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">beyond reach, viewing from where we have to look</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">up to the divine, the sun, our blindness. It is always</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the line of trees and wires, where his advantage of</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">looking down serves as equal. Now so close the</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">messenger wants his voice to be the only sound, my</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">attention so focused, exhales finally. I take down the</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">webs, wipe dust from cracked panes, open the smallest</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">window, leave it open for his coming and going. I\u2019ll</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">have to wait, ponder as he prepares. Two of a kind,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">readying our defense. Our lives will ultimately accept</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">what each has come to realize\u2014how to translate this</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">culture for the hungry, the seemingly lost, those who</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">never knew what we have kept guarded so carefully</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for such as them.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><em>Kangi \u2013 Crow (Lakota language)</em></p>\n"}, {"title": "My 24 Hour Version", "view_node": "/poem/my-24-hour-version", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/lois-red-elk\" hreflang=\"en\">Lois Red Elk</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <p>Light pried open my eyes for vision to<br />unravel the layered dream bundle tossed<br />my way last night.
