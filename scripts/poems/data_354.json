Punk rock anamorphosis had ended long ago, so I switched to Penalzombion.</p><p>*</p><p>While I enjoyed the ultra-feminine high that Penalzombion enfaulked from my kinesthetic being, it had the unfortunate side effect of causing me to hate most poetry I hear, or maybe that was just poetry. In any case, the constant sore throat or what they call the \"Penalzombion engorgement\" became highly inconvenient when I needed to sing impromptu arias for job talks on composition theory. So I switched to Rubicon.</p><p>*</p><p>Though not technically a blocker, Rubicon had several advantages in terms of how it personified and mirrored my t-levels internally. A short-range tactical missile flew by in search of its drone-targeted recipient. Testosterone self-reflectiveness on Rubicon invaded my being on a coding level of intensity to the point where rows of shark teeth swallowed every time management skill I ever learned. There was no going back. I decided that Rubicon was too much of a simultaneously alienated and intimately ski mask experience. So I switched to Novascotia.</p><p>*</p><p>The best side effect of Novascotia was its remoteness. Though it made me feel slightly alienated around other poets, I did manage to get a lot of writing done. However, in the process I lost all sense of reality and missed my grant deadlines for the fourth time. A mouse ear grew out of my hand. Peach cobbler. So I switched to Nepotismapolitan.</p><p>*</p><p>With Nepotismapolitan I definitely engrotted some anti-testosterone connections in the entertainment world, which had me at an advantage when passing as entertainmentally female, but my pores became enormous. When I think back I wonder if Nepotismapolitan was taunting me the whole time. Gam tumescent wing growth polited out of the sinking vessel. Due to interaction warnings I couldn't eat too much processed food anymore and my T levels were still too high, so I switched to Wellmasteride.</p><p>*</p><p>I liked the feeling of cosmic omnipotence corresponding with complete and utter abjection that Wellmasteride gave me, being at once a unique delicate flower/snowflake and a humanistic reproconfection seeking air time like every other platelet in the bloodstream, but it made me inconveniently leery of discussions about trigger warnings and delaying puberty in children. Pang of detained weekend fixture turned permanent yawp. I stopped thugging around in my endocrine blotter with Wellmasteride, and instead turned to Jaimeleecuritsol.</p><p>*</p><p>Jaimeleecurtisol made me witty and urbane. Being around me was like an episode of female Frasier slightly sped up. But soon the crash happened and we were in a recession. Jaimeleecurtisol caused me to scream and scream at the horrible truth coming at me about how people really perceived my gender suddenly rushing at me around street corners. So I switched to Smallpondilaxone.</p><p>*</p><p>Smallpondilaxone made me feel big.<br />For a minute I contemplated calling an agent<br />to discuss my enormous very specialized coupon stash, but I<br />couldn't get out of bed. So next I tried Crepusculane.</p><p>*</p><p>Now the great thing about Crepusculane was that on this one I really felt like myself on five cups of coffee for a few minutes lugging a trampoline up the capital steps past the stone lions that guarded the secret to what's inside increasingly smaller panties I never held any responsibility for, a good place to do research. I made all kinds of appointments to publish poet things and attend everybody's readings in a stacker, almost steroid-like configuration demented with charm. But the hyper-concentration that Crepusculane offers caused me instead to stare at a Grecian Urn for days on end, transfixed by thoughts of lighting up and smoking the latest poet laureate or at least getting a medical prescription for him/her to become culturally all over me. Crepusculane rendered my t-levels nearly invisible as I lay swooning across a Chatterton velvet couch in my garret, but there was no one around but me to serenade, so I switched to Lesbiamine.</p><p>*</p><p>Lesbiamine caused .......................................... in peace talks ...........<br />...............................................................................................................<br />.............................. rankled tall girl spat juicer ............................ but<br />...............................................................................................................<br />......... looks at your spork ................... like a gorgon, tufts of ..........<br />...............................................................................................................<br />kissing us in the museum ....................................................................<br />....................... making me ................. attachment weekend blocker\u00a0<br />...............................................................................................................<br />my leg around your ..............................................................................<br />.................................. wetter, a death ................... bank holiday itch\u00a0<br />...............................................................................................................<br />clasped \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 in a restaurant booth ........<br />...... or vamp stamped .................. something chocolate ..................<br />...............................................................................................................<br />..............................anxiety being unsexy\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..............<br />..................and you need lateness \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...................<br />destorying me\u00a0.....................................................................................<br />.................................................................too intense...........................</p><p>like the crushed flower.

It's quiet here and there are sheep and no wolves masquerading as bears climbing the hillside of an apple danish I bought from my student loan debt ceiling. As long as I pay the credit card bills by end of the month and get my name changed in time for the church basement sale, maybe I can find a way to live. As my body reaches a kind of equilibrium, I am trying to have as small a percentage of me as possible be fabricated as method acting and as great a possibility as a pink skull half-shaven skyline be real. The valleys are so lush and steep.

Good thing I picked up a Fanta orange soda on the way home just in case. Walking back, I couldn't help noticing how most of the neighborhood has been replaced by strange towering steel and plate glass structures. A man was lying across the sidewalk in front of one of them and asked me for money. Greece is being bullied by Germany holding it to a double standard. When they had the tickertape parade for the US Women's Soccer Team this week and said \"Canyon of Heroines\" on the radio I started to laugh and realized it wasn't funny. The guy at an adjacent table in the coffee shop was looking at me smokily for an hour like he wanted to do something to me all over the counter,\u00a0and I sat poised anticipating an advance that never arrived.\u00a0I have trans woman friends who desperately need hope and jobs and love and safety and family. I wish I could be twenty places at once and have the power to fix everything but in a stealth way so I wouldn't be just grabbing the spotlight. True Detective is a TV show that a lot of people seem to enjoy. I trained myself to speak at a higher base pitch every morning until it became quasi-permanent because that is how I know I do not depend on the medical establishment or strangers' willingness to imagine charity. Much of the street is submerged underwater due to the storm. That other salesman can assist you\u2014I'm helping this young lady right now, he said, placing his hand on the small of my back. The entire auditorium of people staring me down was hostile but knew they couldn't show it in public except for occasional frown lines darting from between their eyebrows. Please stand clear of the closing doors. I can't breathe in this dress. I can't seem to figure out where that smell is coming from in the apartment. Gender identity or expression will not protect you from being fired in most employment situations nor does being a transsexual. Split a capsule of medication into smaller doses by opening, dividing, and mixing it among separate containers of a mushy food like applesauce. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was signed this week amid much controversy. Did I just write all that? History is transmisogynistic but it won't be the more of it there is. The beautiful woman suggested I put my bare legs across her lap in the dark so I did and she gently ran her fingers along them. Wheat germ is where the problems all started. Later you asked if you could put your arm around me on the train but there was a scary guy shouting at everyone in the subway car and I didn't want to provoke him. People I love are at risk of being violently harmed or murdered every day, or they suffer from suicidal urges because of how the world fails to see us as people in a million sharp pointy little ways. Welcome to the military. The three-panel dressing room mirror had a Busby Berkeley effect which gave me a little thrill but I might have just imagined it. I wish I knew how to code things with boolean operators. I wish I knew how to read philosophy. The x-ray machine operator kept repeating \"STOP BREATHING NOW DON'T BREATHE\" each time he activated the machine. #CaitlynJenner</p> "}, {"title": "Exclusively on Venus", "view_node": "/poem/exclusively-venus", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/trace-peterson\" hreflang=\"en\">Trace Peterson</a>", "field_date_published": "2016", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are red / violets are transsexual / welcome to womanhood / now get to work honey</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are performative / violets are biological / I have very sensitive breasts / and so do your breasts</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are biological / you have the nicest skin / I can't stop kissing you / let's read more nondualistic queer theory</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are fed up / with our binary fetishes / I tricked my doctors / and stole all the medication to hide it in a cave and share it with other trans people</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses have got me / up against the wall / kissing my neck / which is socially constructed to be a super hot strong feminist neck</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are violet / violets are roses / I really like you / I like you tube</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are born this way / violets have a lesbian streak / something about your dry sense of humor and our soft intertwined limbs / feels transcendently female</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are blue / violets are violet / roses are nonviolet / blue is bluenormative</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are from mars / violets had the whole surgery / setting up camp / exclusively on Venus</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses have gone too far / not to be what girls are made of / I'm coming out / to my academic colleagues as a poet and I bet they will run away screaming</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are roses / violets are born this way / someone's got a hoard / of heteronormative transaffirmation porn you say?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are cheeky / I want you to fuck me / drown violets like an accused witch / in your arms which feel like mine</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Violets got a name change / roses changed a pronoun / we ate at a restaurant / and forgot to put the leftovers in the fridge</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Roses are trochaic / violets have their original plumbing / let's march in a protest / then go home and we'll cook something delicious and eat it with a spork</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Violets are permanent / roses are impermanent / thank you for becoming me / offering to embrace your form your fate</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Flowerbeds are umbrellas / umbrellas are rubrics / I support your identification / and your disidentification</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Men are from women / roses are from Jupiter / women are from men / I can't tell which is softer, your lips or this pillow or the snow descending gracefully outside</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "How the Milky Way Was Made", "view_node": "/poem/how-milky-way-was-made", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/natalie-diaz\" hreflang=\"und\">Natalie Diaz</a>", "field_date_published": "2016", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">My river was once unseparated.
