quiet island,</span>   \nHere to put your lips upon mine I permit you,   \nWith the comrade's long-dwelling kiss or the new husband's kiss, \nFor I am the new husband and I am the comrade.   \n   \nOr if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,   \nWhere I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,   \nCarry me when you go forth over land or sea;   \nFor thus merely touching you is enough, is best,\n<span class=\"long-line\">And thus touching you, would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.</span>   \n   \nBut these leaves conning you con at peril,   \nFor these leaves and me you will not understand,   \n<span class=\"long-line\">They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you,</span>   \n<span class=\"long-line\">Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!</span>\nAlready you see I have escaped from you.   \n   \n<span class=\"long-line\">For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book, </span>  \nNor is it by reading it you will acquire it,   \n<span class=\"long-line\">Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,   </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few,) prove victorious,</span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more, </span>   \n<span class=\"long-line\">For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at;</span>   \nTherefore release me and depart on

"<p><span class=\"long-line\">1 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I wander all night in my vision, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">How solemn they look there, stretch\u2019d and still, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The wretched features of ennuyes, the white features of corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The gash\u2019d bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-door\u2019d rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from gates, and the dying emerging from gates, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The night pervades them and infolds them. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son sleeps, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the murder\u2019d person, how does he sleep? </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The female that loves unrequited sleeps, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the male that loves unrequited sleeps, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and the most restless, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The earth recedes from me into the night, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is beautiful. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers each in turn, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I become the other dreamers. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I am a dance\u2014play up there! the fit is whirling me fast! </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I am the ever-laughing\u2014it is new moon and twilight, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way I look, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it is neither ground nor sea. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch\u2019d arms, and resume the way; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting music and wild-flapping pennants of joy! </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to-day, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The stammerer, the well-form\u2019d person, the wasted or feeble person. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I am she who adorn\u2019d herself and folded her hair expectantly, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My truant lover has come, and it is dark. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Double yourself and receive me darkness, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without him. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He rises with me silently from the bed. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and panting, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Be careful darkness! already what was it touch\u2019d me? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">2 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman\u2019s, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson\u2019s stockings. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is blank here, for reasons. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">(It seems to me that every thing in the light and air ought to be happy, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough.) </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">3 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies of the sea, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on the rocks. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime of his middle age? </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Steady and long he struggles, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He is baffled, bang\u2019d, bruis\u2019d, he holds out while his strength holds out, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away, they roll him, swing him, turn him, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually bruis\u2019d on rocks, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">4 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I turn but do not extricate myself, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Confused, a past-reading, another, but with darkness yet. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I cannot aid with my wringing fingers, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash\u2019d to us alive, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">5 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Now of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench\u2019d hills amid a crowd of officers. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch\u2019d from his cheeks, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their parents. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The same at last and at last when peace is declared, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov\u2019d soldiers all pass through, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another, he shakes hands and bids good-by to the army. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">6 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on the old homestead. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop\u2019d her face, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">My mother look\u2019d in delight and amazement at the stranger, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She look\u2019d at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and pliant limbs, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The more she look\u2019d upon her she loved her, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook\u2019d food for her, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the afternoon she went away, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">O my mother was loth to have her go away, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the week she thought of her, she watch\u2019d for her many a month, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She remember\u2019d her many a winter and many a summer, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">7 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A show of the summer softness\u2014a contact of something unseen\u2014an amour of the light and air, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am jealous and overwhelm\u2019d with friendliness, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And will go gallivant with the light and air myself. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">O love and summer, you are in the dreams and in me, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Autumn and winter are in the dreams, the farmer goes with his thrift, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The droves and crops increase, the barns are well-fill\u2019d. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in the dreams, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sailor sails, the exile returns home, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The fugitive returns unharm\u2019d, the immigrant is back beyond months and years, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood with the well known neighbors and faces, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They warmly welcome him, he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well off, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage home, and the native of the Mediterranean voyages home, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill\u2019d ships, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian goes his way, the Hungarian his way, and the Pole his way, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The homeward bound and the outward bound, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuye, the onanist, the female that loves unrequited, the money-maker, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The actor and actress, those through with their parts and those waiting to commence, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee that is chosen and the nominee that has fail\u2019d, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The great already known and the great any time after to-day, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-form\u2019d, the homely, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that sat and sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the jury, the audience, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight widow, the red squaw, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he that is wrong\u2019d, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The antipodes, and every one between this and them in the dark, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I swear they are averaged now\u2014one is no better than the other, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The night and sleep have liken\u2019d them and restored them. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I swear they are all beautiful, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Every one that sleeps is beautiful, every thing in the dim light is beautiful, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Peace is always beautiful, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The myth of heaven indicates peace and night. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The myth of heaven indicates the soul, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The soul is always beautiful, it appears more or it appears less, it comes or it lags behind, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It comes from its embower\u2019d garden and looks pleasantly on itself and encloses the world, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting,and perfect and clean the womb cohering, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The head well-grown proportion\u2019d and plumb, and the bowels and joints proportion\u2019d and plumb. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The soul is always beautiful, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its place, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What has arrived is in its place and what waits shall be in its place, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to go on in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their turns, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall flow and unite\u2014they unite now. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">8 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie unclothed, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They flow hand in hand over the whole earth from east to west as they lie unclothed, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the European and American are hand in hand, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Learn\u2019d and unlearn\u2019d are hand in hand, and male and female are hand in hand, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast of her lover, they press close without lust, his lips press her neck, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his arms with measureless love, and the son holds the father in his arms with measureless love, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The white hair of the mother shines on the white wrist of the daughter, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the man, friend is inarm\u2019d by friend, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The scholar kisses the teacher and the teacher kisses the scholar, the wrong \u2019d made right, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The call of the slave is one with the master\u2019s call, and the master salutes the slave, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane becomes sane, the suffering of sick persons is reliev\u2019d, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was unsound is sound, the lungs of the consumptive are resumed, the poor distress\u2019d head is free, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as ever, and smoother than ever, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stiflings and passages open, the paralyzed become supple, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The swell\u2019d and convuls\u2019d and congested awake to themselves in condition, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They pass the invigoration of the night and the chemistry of the night, and awake. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I too pass from the night, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and love you. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am not afraid, I have been well brought forward by you, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I love the rich running day, but I do not desert her in whom I lay so long, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you, but </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I know I came well and shall go well. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I will stop only a time with the night, and rise betimes, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I will duly pass the day O my mother, and duly return to you.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness", "view_node": "/poem/hymn-god-my-god-my-sickness", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/john-donne\" hreflang=\"und\">John Donne</a>",
