/><br />It sank, and I am wrapt in utter gloom;<br />How far is night advanced, and when will day<br />Retinge the dusk and livid air with bloom,<br />And fill this void with warm, creative ray?<br />Would I could sleep again till, clear and red,<br />Morning shall on the mountain-tops be spread!<br /><br />I'd call my women, but to break their sleep,<br />Because my own is broken, were unjust;<br />They've wrought all day, and well-earn'd slumbers steep<br />Their labours in forgetfulness, I trust;<br />Let me my feverish watch with patience bear,<br />Thankful that none with me its sufferings share.<br /><br />Yet, oh, for light! one ray would tranquillize<br />My nerves, my pulses, more than effort can;<br />I'll draw my curtain and consult the skies:<br />These trembling stars at dead of night look wan,<br />Wild, restless, strange, yet cannot be more drear<br />Than this my couch, shared by a nameless fear.<br /><br />All black\u2014one great cloud, drawn from east to west,<br />Conceals the heavens, but there are lights below;<br />Torches burn in Jerusalem, and cast<br />On yonder stony mount a lurid glow.<br />I see men station'd there, and gleaming spears;<br />A sound, too, from afar, invades my ears.<br /><br />Dull, measured strokes of axe and hammer ring<br />From street to street, not loud, but through the night<br />Distinctly heard\u2014and some strange spectral thing<br />Is now uprear'd\u2014and, fix'd against the light<br />Of the pale lamps, defined upon that sky,<br />It stands up like a column, straight and high.<br /><br />I see it all\u2014I know the dusky sign\u2014<br />A cross on Calvary, which Jews uprear<br />While Romans watch; and when the dawn shall shine<br />Pilate, to judge the victim, will appear\u2014<br />Pass sentence-yield Him up to crucify;<br />And on that cross the spotless Christ must die.<br /><br />Dreams, then, are true\u2014for thus my vision ran;<br />Surely some oracle has been with me,<br />The gods have chosen me to reveal their plan,<br />To warn an unjust judge of destiny:<br />I, slumbering, heard and saw; awake I know,<br />Christ's coming death, and Pilate's life of woe.<br /><br />I do not weep for Pilate\u2014who could prove<br />Regret for him whose cold and crushing sway<br />No prayer can soften, no appeal can move:<br />Who tramples hearts as others trample clay,<br />Yet with a faltering, an uncertain tread,<br />That might stir up reprisal in the dead.<br /><br />Forced to sit by his side and see his deeds;<br />Forced to behold that visage, hour by hour,<br />In whose gaunt lines the abhorrent gazer reads<br />A triple lust of gold, and blood, and power;<br />A soul whom motives fierce, yet abject, urge\u2014<br />Rome's servile slave, and Judah's tyrant scourge.<br /><br />How can I love, or mourn, or pity him?<br />I, who so long my fetter'd hands have wrung;<br />I, who for grief have wept my eyesight dim ;<br />Because, while life for me was bright and young,<br />He robb'd my youth\u2014he quench'd my life's fair ray\u2014<br />He crush'd my mind, and did my freedom slay.<br /><br />And at this hour\u2014although I be his wife\u2014<br />He has no more of tenderness from me<br />Than any other wretch of guilty life ;<br />Less, for I know his household privacy\u2014<br />I see him as he is\u2014without a screen;<br />And, by the gods, my soul abhors his mien!<br /><br />Has he not sought my presence, dyed in blood\u2014<br />Innocent, righteous blood, shed shamelessly?<br />And have I not his red salute withstood?<br />Ay, when, as erst, he plunged all Galilee<br />In dark bereavement\u2014in affliction sore,<br />Mingling their very offerings with their gore.<br /><br />Then came he\u2014in his eyes a serpent-smile,<br />Upon his lips some false, endearing word,<br />And through the streets of Salem clang'd the while<br />His slaughtering, hacking, sacrilegious sword\u2014<br />And I, to see a man cause men such woe,<br />Trembled with ire\u2014I did not fear to show.<br /><br />And now, the envious Jewish priests have brought<br />Jesus\u2014whom they in mock'ry call their king\u2014<br />To have, by this grim power, their vengeance wrought;<br />By this mean reptile, innocence to sting.<br />Oh! could I but the purposed doom avert,<br />And shield the blameless head from cruel hurt!<br /><br

safe,<br />Unless that bitter priesthood should prevail,<br />And make even terror to their malice quail.<br /><br />Yet if I tell the dream\u2014but let me pause.<br />What dream? Erewhile the characters were clear,<br />Graved on my brain\u2014at once some unknown cause<br />Has dimm'd and razed the thoughts, which now appear,<br />Like a vague remnant of some by-past scene;\u2014<br />Not what will be, but what, long since, has been.<br /><br />I suffer'd many things\u2014I heard foretold<br />A dreadful doom for Pilate,\u2014lingering woes,<br />In far, barbarian climes, where mountains cold<br />Built up a solitude of trackless snows,<br />There he and grisly wolves prowl'd side by side,<br />There he lived famish'd\u2014there, methought, he died;<br /><br />But not of hunger, nor by malady;<br />I saw the snow around him, stain'd with gore;<br />I said I had no tears for such as he,<br />And, lo! my cheek is wet\u2014mine eyes run o'er;<br />I weep for mortal suffering, mortal guilt,<br />I weep the impious deed, the blood self-spilt.<br /><br />More I recall not, yet the vision spread<br />Into a world remote, an age to come\u2014<br />And still the illumined name of Jesus shed<br />A light, a clearness, through the unfolding gloom\u2014<br />And still I saw that sign, which now I see,<br />That cross on yonder brow of Calvary.<br /><br />What is this Hebrew Christ? to me unknown<br />His lineage\u2014doctrine\u2014mission; yet how clear<br />Is God-like goodness in his actions shown,<br />How straight and stainless is his life's career!<br />The ray of Deity that rests on him,<br />In my eyes makes Olympian glory dim.<br /><br />The world advances; Greek or Roman rite<br />Suffices not the inquiring mind to stay;<br />The searching soul demands a purer light<br />To guide it on its upward, onward way;<br />Ashamed of sculptured gods, Religion turns<br />To where the unseen Jehovah's altar burns.<br /><br />Our faith is rotten, all our rites defiled,<br />Our temples sullied, and, methinks, this man,<br />With his new ordinance, so wise and mild,<br />Is come, even as He says, the chaff to fan<br />And sever from the wheat; but will his faith<br />Survive the terrors of to-morrow's death ?<br /><br />* * * * * * *<br /><br />I feel a firmer trust\u2014a higher hope<br />Rise in my soul\u2014it dawns with dawning day;<br />Lo! on the Temple's roof\u2014on Moriah's slope<br />Appears at length that clear and crimson ray<br />Which I so wished for when shut in by night;<br />Oh, opening skies, I hail, I bless pour light!<br /><br />Part, clouds and shadows!
