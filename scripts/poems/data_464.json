Fox, he started up at once,\nAnd by the gorget grabbed our Chanticleer,\nFlung him on back, and toward the wood did steer,\nFor there was no man who as yet pursued.\nO destiny, you cannot be eschewed!\nAlas, that Chanticleer flew from the beams!\nAlas, his wife recked nothing of his dreams!\n     This simple widow and her daughters two\nHeard these hens cry and make so great ado,\nAnd out of doors they started on the run\nAnd saw the fox into the grove just gone,\nBearing in his mouth the cock away.\nAnd then they cried, \"Alas, and weladay!\nOh, the fox!\" and after him they ran,\nAnd after them, with staves, went many a man;\nRan Coll, our dog, and Talbot and Garland,\nRan cow and calf and even the very hogs,\nSo were they scared by barking of the dogs\nAnd shouting men and women all did make,\nThey all ran so they thought their hearts would break.\nAnd now, good men, I pray you hearken all.\n     Behold how Fortune turns all suddenly\nThe hope and pride of even her enemy!\nThis cock, which now lay in the fox's mouth,\nIn all his fear unto the fox did clack\nAnd say: \"Sir, were I you, as I should be,\nThen would I say (as God may now help me!),\n'Turn back again, presumptuous peasants all!\nA very pestilence upon you fall!\nNow that I've gained here to this dark wood's side,\nIn spite of you this cock shall here abide.\nI'll eat him, by my faith, and that anon!'\"\nThe fox replied: \"In faith, it shall be done!\"\nAnd as he spoke that word, all suddenly\nThis cock broke from his mouth, full cleverly,\nAnd high upon a tree he flew anon.\nAnd when the fox saw well that he was gone,\n\"Alas,\" quoth he, \"O Chanticleer, alas!\nI have against you done a base trespass\nInasmuch as I made you afeared\nWhen I seized you and brought you from the yard;\nBut, sir, I did it with no foul intent;\nCome down, and I will tell you what I meant.\nI'll tell the truth to you, God help me so!\n\"Nay then,\" said he, \"beshrew us both, you know,\nBut first, beshrew myself, both blood and bones,\nIf you beguile me, having done so once,\nYou shall no more, with any flattery,\nCause me to sing and closeup either eye;\nFor he who shuts his eyes when he should see,\nAnd wilfully, God let him ne'er be free!\"\n\"Nay,\" said the fox, \"but God give him mischance\nWho is so indiscreet in governance\nHe chatters when he ought to hold his peace.\"\n     But you that hold this tale a foolery,\nAs but about a fox, a cock, a hen,\nYet do not miss the moral, my good men.\nFor Saint Paul says that all that's written well\nIs written down some useful truth to tell.\nThen take the wheat and let the chaff lie still.\n     And now, good God, and if it be Thy will,\nAs says Lord Christ, so make us all good men\nAnd bring us into His high bliss.

I am uneasy at heart when I have to leave my accustomed shelter; I forgot that there abides the old in the new, and that there also thou abidest.</p><p>Through birth and death, in this world or in others, wherever thou leadest me it is thou, the same, the one companion of my endless life who ever linkest my heart with bonds of joy to the unfamiliar. When one knows thee, then alien there is none, then no door is shut. Oh, grant me my prayer that I may never lose the bliss of the touch of the One in the play of the many.</p><p><b>II</b></p><p>No more noisy, loud words from me, such is my master\u2019s will. Henceforth I deal in whispers. The speech of my heart will be carried on in murmurings of a song.</p><p>Men hasten to the King\u2019s market. All the buyers and sellers are there. But I have my untimely leave in the middle of the day, in the thick of work.</p><p>Let then the flowers come out in my garden, though it is not their time, and let the midday bees strike up their lazy hum.</p><p>Full many an hour have I spent in the strife of the good and the evil, but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on to him, and I know not why is this sudden call to what useless inconsequence!</p><p><b>III</b></p><p>On the day when the lotus bloomed, alas, my mind was straying, and I knew it not. My basket was empty and the flower remained unheeded.</p><p>Only now and again a sadness fell upon me, and I started up from my dream and felt a sweet trace of a strange smell in the south wind.</p><p>That vague fragrance made my heart ache with longing, and it seemed to me that it was the eager breath of the summer seeking for its completion.</p><p>I knew not then that it was so near, that it was mine, and this perfect sweetness had blossomed in the depth of my own heart.</p><p><b>IV</b></p><p>By all means they try to hold me secure who love me in this world.

What was the power that made me open out into this vast mystery like a bud in the forest at midnight? When in the morning I looked upon the light I felt in a moment that I was no stranger in this world, that the inscrutable without name and form had taken me in its arms in the form of my own mother. Even so, in death the same unknown will appear as ever known to me. And because I love this life, I know I shall love death as well. The child cries out when from the right breast the mother takes it away to find in the very next moment its consolation in the left one.</p><p><b>VI</b></p><p>Thou art the sky and thou art the nest as well. Oh, thou beautiful, there in the nest it is thy love that encloses the soul with colours and sounds and odours. There comes the morning with the golden basket in her right hand bearing the wreath of beauty, silently to crown the earth. And there comes the evening over the lonely meadows deserted by herds, through trackless paths, carrying cool draughts of peace in her golden pitcher from the western ocean of rest.</p><p>But there, where spreads the infinite sky for the soul to take her flight in, reigns the stainless white radiance.
