It was spring,\n\nsuch spring as came to the flintbacked Chenango \nValley thirty years ago, the full force of Siberia \nbehind each blast of wind. Once more my poor wife \nwas in the local four-room hospital, recovering. \nThe sun was going down, the room's pinewood panels \nall but swallowing the gelid light, when, suddenly, \nI surprised not only myself but my colleague\n\nby raising my middle finger up to heaven, <i>quid</i> \n<i>pro quo</i>, the hardly grand defiant gesture a variant \non Vanni Fucci's figs, shocking not only my friend \nbut in truth the gesture's perpetrator too. I was 24, \nand, in spite of having pored over the <i>Confessions</i> \n&amp; that Catholic Tractate called the <i>Summa</i>, was sure \nI'd seen enough of God's erstwhile ways toward man.\n\nThat summer, under a pulsing midnight sky \nshimmering with Van Gogh stars, in a creaking, \ncedarscented cabin off Lake George, having lied \nto the gentrified owner of the boys' camp \nthat indeed I knew wilderness &amp; lakes and could, \nif need be, lead a whole fleet of canoes down \nthe turbulent whitewater passages of the Fulton Chain\n\n(I who had last been in a rowboat with my parents \nat the age of six), my wife and I made love, trying \nnot to disturb whosever headboard &amp; waterglass \nlie just beyond the paperthin partition at our feet. \nIn the great black Adirondack stillness, as we lay \nthere on our sagging mattress, my wife &amp; I gazed out \nthrough the broken roof into a sky that seemed\n\nsomehow to look back down on us, and in that place, \nthat holy place, she must have conceived again, \nfor nine months later in a New York hospital she \nbrought forth a son, a little buddha-bellied \nrumplestiltskin runt of a man who burned \nto face the sun, the fact of his being there \nboth terrifying &amp; lifting me at once, this son,\n\nthis gift, whom I still look upon with joy &amp; awe. Worst, \nbest, just last year, this same son, grown\nto manhood now, knelt before a marble altar to vow \neverything he had to the same God I had had my own \nerstwhile dealings with.

No! One was lame,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And could not dance the whole of the way;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in after years, if you would blame </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His sadness, he was used to say,-- </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I can't forget that I'm bereft</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of all the pleasant sights they see,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which the Piper also promised me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Joining the town and just at hand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And flowers put forth a fairer hue,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And everything was strange and new;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And their dogs outran our fallow deer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And honey-bees had lost their stings,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And horses were born with eagles' wings:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And just as I became assured</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My lame foot would be speedily cured,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The music stopped and I stood still,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And found myself outside the hill,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Left alone against my will, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To go now limping as before, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And never hear of that country more!</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><b>XIV</b></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Alas, alas for Hamelin!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There came into many a burgher's pate</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A text which says that heaven's gate</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Opens to the rich at as easy rate</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As the needle's eye takes a camel in!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The mayor sent East, West, North and South,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To offer the Piper, by word of mouth </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wherever it was men's lot to find him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silver and gold to his heart's content,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If he'd only return the way he went,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And bring the children behind him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Piper and dancers were gone forever,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They made a decree that lawyers never </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Should think their records dated duly </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If, after the day of the month and year, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">These words did not as well appear:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"And so long after what happened here</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the twenty-second of July, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thirteen hundred and seventy-six;\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the better in memory to fix </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The place of the children's last retreat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They called it the Pied Piper's Street,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where any one playing on pipe or tabor </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was sure for the future to lose his labor. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To shock with mirth a street so solemn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But opposite the place of the cavern</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They wrote the story on a column,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And on the great church-window painted </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The same, to make the world acquainted </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How their children were stolen away,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And there it stands to this very day.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I must not omit to say</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That, in Transylvania there's a tribe</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of alien people who ascribe</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the outlandish ways and dress</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On which their neighbors lay such stress,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To their fathers and mothers having risen </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Out of some subterranean prison </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into which they were trepanned</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long time ago in a mighty band </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But how or why they don't understand.</span></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><b>XV</b></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So, Willy, let you and me be wipers </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of scores out with all men--especially pipers!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, whether they pipe us free, from rats or from mice, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If we've promised them ought, let us keep
