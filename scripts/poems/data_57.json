Maybe a six-week supply, plus a go-backpack full of cans, extensions, spare Mick-E button. Three days of food for the rest of us. We\u2019ll find water.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Sleeping in the front seats, taking turns on watch. Simone curled up next to the gas can and ziplock of batteries/cords/chargers, with her one stuffed animal we have to worry about something happening to, her only toy.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0what\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 we\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 lose\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 car?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Running\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 some\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 side\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 road to\u2014Pennsylvania/airport/Atlantic/evacuation center/relocation camp/as yet unknown. Trying to buy a blow-up raft for four people. Can\u2019t take the wheelchair.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Our stack of euros to buy four plane tickets: can\u2019t take the wheelchair.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">On foot, trying to get to a friend\u2019s country home, promise of a bedroom. No way to call the friend for directions. A compass one of the kids got at a birthday party wound up under a car seat. Lucky. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Lucky too Simone can walk\u2014though she gets tired and I\u2019d want to hoist her on my back if I didn\u2019t have to save my energy to carry Cal when Craig\u2019s legs give way, his back out.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Cal, four foot six and sixty pounds of tween, who must be carried if we somehow lose that wheelchair. Or the wheelchair breaks, or is stolen, or gets a flat tire, or rusts.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It\u2019s red, a color Cal chose by smiling when we said \u201cred\u201d in a list of colors. No expression when we said blue, green, black, purple or pink. Big smile when we said red. He had his choice and he made it.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">How strange that the color of his wheelchair ever mattered enough to anyone to offer him that handful of options.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Simone is hungry. I give her a Clif bar (that 24 pack I bought for rushed mornings) and she drops half of it on the dirt road, which is covered in, what, bone dust or atomized drywall?\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">She grabs what she dropped and stuffs it into her mouth before I can stop her. Why would I stop her?\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The side of the road is the well-known gutter of desperation always included in stories about wars where many people have to move on foot to the next terrible place.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No matter what the emergency, whenever people are forced to flee you find, piece by piece, how their understanding of their situation changed.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">If you read the stories, you\u2019re supposed to find abandoned photo albums, suitcases, babies. The useless things cut out by survival\u2019s swift knife. Dead weight, long gone.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">You never find food, bottled water, working flashlights, live batteries, short wave radios. It\u2019s true, what all those stories said, it turns out.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Eventually out of water and arms shredded, I carry Cal, Craig carries me, and Simone carries us all. Almost seven years old, she is so strong and has some Clif bars stuffed in a bag. The notebook with all our information is long lost.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">She knows where she\u2019s going. How does she know that?\u00a0 She runs ahead and carries us, her heart pounding and breaking with the weight and strain of all of us in there.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Blueberries for Cal", "view_node": "/poem/blueberries-cal", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/brenda-shaughnessy\" hreflang=\"und\">Brenda Shaughnessy</a>", "field_date_published": "2019", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Watching little Henry, 6, scoop up blueberries</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and shovel them into his mouth, possessed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019m so glad I brought blueberries\u2014wish my kids</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">could/would eat them.

They say she was driving to work when she saw him, or did they say she was delivering a bouquet of fresh cut flowers to someone on their birthday, or had just come from the door of some sweet couple\u2019s fiftieth anniversary? I can\u2019t remember all of that right now. All I can think about is what she must have known about flowers before this moment began. I know she was a woman out on the road driving and paying very close attention to the world around her. She was also a woman who did not look away when she saw his soup-bowl haircut pass by one lane over. Was his upside-down empty vase of a neck the giveaway? In the car that was not going too fast and not going too slow. In the car that had a backseat. Was the backseat where he put the gun that he had just used to kill the nine praying sunflowers of Mother Emanuel? Or was the gun there in the front seat with him? By then, back in Charleston the nine passion flowers were slumped on the basement floor inside the church. The nine calla lilies had been snapped in two. She saw his funny haircut and quickly recognized him as the one who had just taken the lives of the nine human beings, in mid and full bloom, who had welcomed him, called him son, invited him to sit and be with them in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Ten fragrant gardenias had welcomed him to their circle and the flower lady was the one who recognized the long flowerless vase of his neck and made the call. What did she say on that\u00a0phone? Hello. I\u2019m calling to report a sighting. That young man you are looking for . . . who shot up that church . . . he\u2019s here on the highway with me . . . a black Hyundai.
