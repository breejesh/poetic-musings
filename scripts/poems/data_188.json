Care not how\nThe old grace goes, how heavy I am grown,\nBig with this loneliness, how you alone\nPonder our love. Touch my feet and feel\nHow earth tingles, teeming at my heel!\nEarth\u2019s urge, not mine,\u2014my little death, not hers;\nAnd the pure beauty yearns and stirs.\n\nIt does not heed our ecstacies, it turns\nWith secrets of its own, its own concerns,\nToward a windy world of its own, toward stark\nAnd solitary places. In the dark,\nDefiant even now, it tugs and moans\nTo be untangled from these mother\u2019s bones.\n</pre>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 188, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
