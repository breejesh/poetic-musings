The pains in my stomach had grown\nGradually sharper &amp; more frequent as the day\nWore on, &amp; now a fever had set up house.\nIn the villages there wasn't much point in asking\nAnyone for help. In those places, where tanks\nWere bivouacked in shade on their way back\nFrom some routine exercise along\nThe Danube, even food was scarce that year.\nAnd the languages shifted for no clear reason\nFrom two hard quarries of Slavic into German,\nThen to a shred of Latin spliced with oohs\nAnd hisses. Even when I tried the simplest phrases,\nThe peasants passing over those uneven stones\nPaused just long enough to look up once,\nUncomprehendingly. Then they turned\nQuickly away, vanishing quietly into that\nMoment, like bark chips whirled downriver.\nIt was autumn. Beyond each village the wind\nThrew gusts of yellowing leaves across the road.\nThe goats I passed were thin, gray; their hind legs,\nCaked with dried shit, seesawed along\u2014\nNot even mild contempt in their expressionless,\nPale eyes, &amp; their brays like the scraping of metal.\nExcept for one village that had a kind\nOf museum where I stopped to rest, &amp; saw\nA dead Scythian soldier under glass,\nTurning to dust while holding a small sword\nAt attention forever, there wasn't much to look at.\nWind, leaves, goats, the higher passes\nLocked in stone, the peasants with their fate\nEmbroidering a stillness into them,\nAnd a spell over all things in that landscape,\nLike . . .\n             That was the trouble; it couldn't be\n<i>Compared</i> to anything else, not even the sleep\nOf some asylum at a wood's edge with the sound\nOf a pond's spillway beside it. But as each cramp\nGrew worse &amp; lasted longer than the one before,\nIt was hard to keep myself aloof from the threadbare\nWorld walking on that road. After all,\nEven as they moved, the peasants, the herds of goats\nAnd cattle, the spiralling leaves, at least were part\nOf that spell, that stillness.\n                    After a while,\nThe villages grew even poorer, then thinned out,\nThen vanished entirely. An hour later,\nThere were no longer even the goats, only wind,\nThen more &amp; more leaves blown over the road, sometimes\nCovering it completely for a second.\nAnd yet, except for a random oak or some brush\nWrithing out of the ravine I drove beside,\nThe trees had thinned into rock, into large,\nTough blonde rosettes of fading pasture grass.\nThen <i>that</i> gave out in a bare plateau. . . . And then,\nEasing the Dacia down a winding grade\nIn second gear, rounding a long, funneled curve\u2014\nIn a complete stillness of yellow leaves filling\nA wide field\u2014like something thoughtlessly,\nMistakenly erased, the road simply ended.\nI stopped the car. There was no wind now.\nI expected that, &amp; though I was sick &amp; lost,\nI wasn't afraid. I should have been afraid.\nTo this day I don't know why I wasn't.\nI could hear time cease, the field quietly widen.\nI could feel the spreading stillness of the place\nMoving like something I'd witnessed as a child,\nLike the ancient, armored leisure of some reptile\nGliding, gray-yellow, into the slightly tepid,\nUnidentical gray-brown stillness of the water\u2014\nSomething blank &amp; unresponsive in its tough,\nPimpled skin\u2014seen only a moment, then unseen\nAs it submerged to rest on mud, or glided just\nBeneath the lustreless, calm yellow leaves\nThat clustered along a log, or floated there\nIn broken ringlets, held by a gray froth\nOn the opaque, unbroken surface of the pond,\nWhich reflected nothing, no one.\n                    And then I remembered.\nWhen I was a child, our neighbors would disappear.\nAnd there wasn't a pond of crocodiles at all.\nAnd they hadn't moved. They couldn't move. They\nLived in the small, fenced-off backwater\nOf a canal. I'd never seen them alive. They\nWere in still photographs taken on the Ivory Coast.\nI saw them only once in a studio when\nI was a child in a city I once loved.\nI was afraid until our neighbor, a photographer,\nExplained it all to me, explained how far\nAway they were, how harmless; how they were praised\nIn rituals as \"powers.\" But they had no \"powers,\"\nHe said. The next week he vanished. I thought\nSomeone had cast a spell &amp; that the crocodiles\nSwam out of the pictures on the wall &amp; grew\nSilently &amp; multiplied &amp; then turned into\nShadows resting on the banks of lakes &amp; streams\nOr took the shapes of fallen logs in campgrounds\nIn the mountains. They ate our neighbor, Mr. Hirata. \nThey ate his whole family. That is what I believed,\nThen. . .that someone had cast a spell. I did not\nKnow childhood was a spell, or that then there\nHad been another spell, too quiet to hear,\nEntering my city, entering the dust we ate. . . .\nNo one knew it then. No one could see it,\nThough it spread through lawnless miles of housing tracts,\nAnd the new, bare, treeless streets; it slipped\nInto the vacant rows of warehouses &amp; picked\nThe padlocked doors of working-class bars\nAnd union halls &amp; shuttered, empty diners.\nAnd how it clung! (forever, if one had noticed)\nTo the brothel with the pastel tassels on the shade\nOf an unlit table lamp. Farther in, it feasted\nOn the decaying light of failing shopping centers;\nIt spilled into the older, tree-lined neighborhoods,\nInto warm houses, sealing itself into books\nOf bedtime stories read each night by fathers\u2014\nThe books lying open to the flat, neglected\nLight of dawn; &amp; it settled like dust on windowsills\nDowntown, filling the smug caf\u00e9s, schools, \nBanks, offices, taverns, gymnasiums, hotels,\nNewsstands, courtrooms, opium parlors, Basque\nRestaurants, Armenian steam baths,\nFrench bakeries, &amp; two of the florists' shops\u2014\nTheir plate glass windows smashed forever.\nFinally it tried to infiltrate the exact\nCenter of my city, a small square bordered\nWith palm trees, olives, cypresses, a square\nWhere no one gathered, not even thieves or lovers.\nIt was a place which no longer had any purpose,\nBut held itself aloof, I thought, the way\nA deaf aunt might, from opinions, styles, gossip.\nI liked it there. It was completely lifeless,\nSad &amp; clear in what seemed always a perfect, \nWindless noon. I saw it first as a child,\nLooking down at it from that as yet \nUnvandalized, makeshift studio.\nI remember leaning my right cheek against\nA striped beach ball so that Mr. Hirata\u2014\nWho was Japanese, who would be sent the next week\nTo a place called Manzanar, a detention camp\nHidden in stunted pines almost above\nThe Sierra timberline\u2014could take my picture.\nI remember the way he lovingly relished \nEach camera angle, the unwobbling tripod, \nThe way he checked each aperture against\nThe light meter, in love with all things\nThat were not accidental, &amp; I remember\nThe care he took when focusing; how\nHe tried two different lens filters before\nHe found the one appropriate for that\nSensual, late, slow blush of afternoon\nFalling through the one broad bay window.\nI remember holding still &amp; looking down\nInto the square because he asked me to;\nBecause my mother &amp; father had asked me please\nTo obey &amp; be patient &amp; allow the man\u2014\nWhose business was failing anyway by then\u2014\nTo work as long as he wished to without any\nIrritations or annoyances before\nHe would have to spend these years, my father said,\nFar away, in snow, &amp; without his cameras.\nBut Mr. Hirata did not work. He played.\nHis toys gleamed there. That much was clear to me . . . .\nThat was the day I decided I would never work.\nIt felt like a conversion. Play was sacred.\nMy father waited behind us on a sofa made\nFrom car seats. One spring kept nosing through.\nI remember the camera opening into the light . . . .\nAnd I remember the dark after, the studio closed,\nThe cameras stolen, slivers of glass from the smashed\nBay window littering the unsanded floors,\nAnd the square below it bathed in sunlight . . . . All this\nBefore Mr. Hirata died, months later,\nFrom complications following pneumonia.\nHis death, a letter from a camp official said,\nWas purely accidental. I didn't believe it.\nDiseases were wise. Diseases, like the polio\nMy sister had endured, floating paralyzed\nAnd strapped into her wheelchair all through\nThat war, seemed too precise. Like photographs . . .\nExcept disease left nothing. Disease was like\nAnd equation that drank up light &amp; never ended,\nNot even in summer. Before my fever broke,\nAnd the pains lessened, I could actually see\nMyself, in the exact center of that square.\nHow still it had become in my absence, &amp; how\nImmaculate, windless, sunlit. I could see\nThe outline of every leaf on the nearest tree,\nSee it more clearly than ever, more clearly than\nI had seen anything before in my whole life:\nAgainst the modest, dark gray, solemn trunk,\nThe leaves were becoming only what they had to be\u2014\nCalm, yellow, things in themselves &amp; nothing\nMore\u2014&amp; frankly they were nothing in themselves,\nNothing except their little reassurance\nOf persisting for a few more days, or returning\nThe year after, &amp; the year after that, &amp; every\nYear following\u2014estranged from us by now\u2014&amp; clear,\nSo clear not one in a thousand trembled; hushed\nAnd always coming back\u2014steadfast, orderly,\nTaciturn, oblivious\u2014until the end of Time.\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "In a Country", "view_node": "/poem/country", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/larry-levis\" hreflang=\"und\">Larry Levis</a>", "field_date_published": "1977", "body": "<pre>\nMy love and I are inventing a country, which we \ncan already see taking shape, as if wheels were \npassing through yellow mud.

Here, for example, is\nThe Piazza Navona, &amp; here is his narrow room\nOverlooking the Steps &amp; the crowds of sunbathing\nTourists. And here is the Protestant Cemetery\nWhere Keats &amp; Joseph Severn join hands\nForever under a little shawl of grass\nAnd where Keats' name isn't even on\nHis gravestone, because it is on Severn's,\nAnd Joseph Severn's infant son is buried\nTwo modest, grassy steps behind them both.\nBut you'd have to know the story\u2014how bedridden\nKeats wanted the inscription to be\nSimple, &amp; unbearable: \"Here lies one\nWhose name is writ in water.\" On a warm day,\nI stood here with my two oldest friends.\nI thought, then, that the three of us would be\nIndissoluble at the end, &amp; also that\nWe would all die, of course. And not die.\nAnd maybe we should have joined hands at that\nMoment. We didn't. All we did was follow\nA lame man in a rumpled suit who climbed\nA slight incline of graves blurring into\nThe passing marble of other graves to visit\nThe vacant home of whatever is not left\nOf Shelley &amp; Trelawney. That walk uphill must\nBe hard if you can't walk. At the top, the man\nWheezed for breath; sweat beaded his face,\nAnd his wife wore a look of concern so\nHabitual it seemed more like the way\nOur bodies, someday, will have to wear stone.\nLater that night, the three of us strolled,\nOur arms around each other, through the Via\nDel Corso &amp; toward the Piazza di Espagna\nAs each street grew quieter until\nFinally we heard nothing at the end\nExcept the occasional scrape of our own steps,\nAnd so we said good-bye.

But this\nIs speculation, &amp; no doubt the simplest fact\nCould shame me. Perhaps the child was from \nCalabria, &amp; went back to it with\nA mother who failed to find work, &amp; perhaps\nThe child died there, twenty years ago,\nOf malaria.

you,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States, I press with slow rude muscle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I brace myself effectually, I listen to no entreaties,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me. </span><br /><br /><span

graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new artists, musicians, and singers, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-spendings,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you interpenetrate now,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death, immortality, I plant so lovingly now.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "The Lost Pilot", "view_node": "/poem/lost-pilot", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/james-tate\" hreflang=\"und\">James Tate</a>",
