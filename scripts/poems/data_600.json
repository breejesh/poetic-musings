A string of numbers plummeted \nthrough it. They were cold numbers. \nThey were pearls.\n\nAnd though they were cold the light they cast was warm,\nand though they were pearls he thought they were eyes.\nThey blinked. He blinked back.\nAnything that blinks\n\nmust be friendly, he thought, until he saw the code\n\u2014a string of numbers\u2014carved into their sides\nand grew afraid. He tried to close\nthe space\n\nbut it was no longer his own. He tried to close his eyes\nbut they were no longer his. He tried to close \nhis mouth, his hands, his ears\nbut they were no longer\n\nhis, were never his to begin with: this was the time of his seeing.\nThe world opened. A line began. A tree grew above him\nand he thanked it. A sun dawned over the line\nand he thanked it.\n\nA building unfolded abruptly and blocked the sun\nand he put his hand on its side and thanked it\nfor the shade, he put his hand\non the sidewalk\n\nand gave thanks to the cement\u2014it was cool and wet and \ntook the shape of his hand into it\u2014he put his eyes\nat the feet of a woman\nand she lifted them,\n\nto her own, and he thanked her, from the inside, and she understood.\nWires swirled above him, straightened out along an avenue\nand the lights came on. One moon rose.\nA second moon\n\nrose on the windshield of a car and he thanked them both.\nThis was the time of his seeing. This was the time.\nAn electric green beetle shuttled out\nof the darkness\n\nand landed on his forearm, pulsing, he didn't remove it.\nIt seemed relieved. Some things work very hard\nto leave the ground. Somewhere an infant\ncalled out, sharply,\n\nwas comforted into silence. The deep note of an owl opened a tunnel \nin the air. He was growing tired. He didn\u2019t want to stop. \nThe world opened. \nA line began.\n\nIt traveled out ahead of him and returned, tracing a wave,\nwhite foam gathering, gathering the moonlight,\nblack water rising into a wall\nand he held up his hand:\n\nthe wall froze, trembling, the head of a seal\npoked through, looked around, withdrew,\nhe liked the way its whiskers\nbent forward\n\nas it withdrew and he liked the way his hand had stopped a wave\nso he thanked his hand and moved on,\ninto the outskirts, the taste\nof salt on his tongue,\n\nthe taste of brine, it made him thirsty although he had no thirst.\nThis was the time of his seeing. This was the time.\nAnd the skeletal shadow of a radio tower\nloomed to the right of him,\n\ncreaking, a red gleam, then nothing, he thought he heard music\npassing through him and he was right: \nhe was humming something\nfrom a song, \n\nbut he couldn't remember the words, which was fine, \nthey were sentimental anyway so he \nthanked the radio tower\nand kept moving,\n\nthe road turning to gravel, the gravel turning to dust,\nthe ditches sang with frogs, the ditches were silent,\na pair of yellow eyes waited for him\nto pass and so he passed,\n\ncalmly, since the beetle was with him, trying to refold its wings,\nand the tree was with him, unfolding its leaves,\nand a man was with him, walking at his side\n\u2014he didn't need to ask\n\nwho he was, so he didn't, but in the corner of his eye\nhe caught a glimpse: he seemed familiar,\nhe looked like him\nand he was,\n\nalthough a string of numbers was carved into his side.\nHe asked if he could touch them and he said Yes,\ntouch them. They were cold numbers.\nThey were pearls.\n\nHe asked if he could kiss him and he said Yes, kiss me, and so he did.\nIt was a strange kiss. It was a beautiful kiss.\nIt seemed to last a long time.\nIt seemed to last a lifetime.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Wild Is the Wind", "view_node": "/poem/wild-wind", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/travis-nichols\" hreflang=\"und\">Travis Nichols</a>", "field_date_published": "2005", "body": " <pre>\nThere is a movie called \"She's Gotta Have It.\"\nThere is a blizzard in Massachusetts today.\nTwenty-one people died in Chicago last night.\nTwo of my friends live there,\nbut I have never wanted to live there\nbecause it is cold there and people die\nfrom the cold and the wind and from each other.\nThere is a movie called \"Chicago.\"\nI saw it yesterday in Massachusetts.\nThe wind is shaking our house this morning\nbut it's warm inside.
