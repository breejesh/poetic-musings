Her hair's coarse gold\nIs spun from the sunlight that it rides upon.\nWomen were paid to knit from sweet champagne\nHer second skin: it winds and unwinds, winds\nUp her long legs, delectable haunches,\nAs she sways, in sunlight, up the gazing aisle.\nThe shade of the tree that is called maidenhair,\nThat is not positively known\nTo exist in a wild state, spots her fair or almost fair\nHair twisted in a French twist; tall or almost tall,\nShe walks through the air the rain has washed, a clear thing\nMoving easily on its high heels, seeming to men\nMiraculous . . . Since I can call her, as Swann couldn't,\nA woman who is my type, I follow with the warmth\nOf familiarity, of novelty, this new\nExample of the type,\nReminded of how Lorenz's just-hatched goslings\nShook off the last remnants of the egg\nAnd, looking at Lorenz, realized that Lorenz\nWas their mother. Quacking, his little family\nFollowed him everywhere; and when they met a goose, \nTheir mother, they ran to him afraid. \n\nImprinted upon me\nIs the shape I run to, the sweet strange\nBreath-taking contours that breathe to me: \"I am yours,\nBe mine!\"\n              Following this new\nBody, somehow familiar, this young shape, somehow old,\nFor a moment I'm younger, the century is younger.\nThe living Strauss, his moustache just getting gray,\nIs shouting to the players: \"Louder!\nLouder!

Garbo\nSays seriously: \"I vish dey'd never met.\"\n\nAs I walk behind this woman I remember\nThat before I flew here\u2014waked in the forest\nAt dawn, by the piece called <i>Birds Beginning Day</i>\nThat, each day, birds play to begin the day\u2014\nI wished as men wish: \"May this day be different!\"\nThe birds were wishing, as birds wish\u2014over and over, \nWith a last firmness, intensity, reality\u2014\n\"May this day be the same!\"\n                                        Ah, turn to me\nAnd look into my eyes, say: \"I am yours, \nBe mine!\"\n              My wish will have come true. And yet\nWhen your eyes meet my eyes, they'll bring into \nThe weightlessness of my pure wish the weight\nOf a human being: someone to help or hurt,\nSomeone to be good to me, to be good to, \nSomeone to cry when I am angry\nThat she doesn't like <i>Elektra</i>, someone to start out on Proust with.\nA wish, come true, is life. I have my life.\nWhen you turn just slide your eyes across my eyes\nAnd show in a look flickering across your face\nAs lightly as a leaf's shade, a bird's wing, \nThat there is no one in the world quite like me, \nThat if only . . . If only . . . \n                                      That will be enough.\n\nBut I've pretended long enough: I walk faster\nAnd come close, touch with the tip of my finger\nThe nape of her neck, just where the gold\nHair stops, and the champagne-colored dress begins. \nMy finger touches her as the gingko's shadow\nTouches her. \n                  Because, after all, it <i>is</i> my wife\nIn a new dress from Bergdorf's, walking toward the park.\nShe cries out, we kiss each other, and walk arm in arm\nThrough the sunlight that's much too good for New York, \nThe sunlight of our own house in the forest.\nStill, though, the poor things need it . . . We've no need\nTo start out on Proust, to ask each other about Strauss. \nWe first helped each other, hurt each other, years ago.\nAfter so many changes made and joys repeated, \nOur first bewildered, transcending recognition \nIs pure acceptance. We can't tell our life\nFrom our wish. Really I began the day\nNot with a man's wish: \"May this day be different,\"\nBut with the birds' wish: \"May this day\nBe the same day, the day of my life.\"</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Chicago

edge.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I should know, Daughter.\u00a0I spent the night </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in a graveyard, behind a tombstone,</span></p>\n\n<p><span

window, I saw a map</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pulled down like a window shade: </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">continents pushed apart, an ocean </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">blotting out names with tears.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">South America and Africa no longer nestled</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like spoons in a

ghost.\u00a0You shiver, Daughter, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but know nothing of the cold. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tumbleweeds roll into town as if they owned it, </span><br

causing pain.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I walk our street at night, the way I always did.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Why didn't you come?\u00a0I had to bark at a tree.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I howled like a dog.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">IX.\u00a0<em>The Library of the

small lady bug\nWith only two black dots on its back\nClimbs like a blind turtle on my pen\nAnd begins to drink ink in the light\n                                             of tradition\nWe're allowed to crowd love in\nLike a significant myth\n                              resting still on paper\nI remember being bitten by a spider\nIt was like feeling what they call\n                                          the life of the mind\nStinging my thigh like Dante\n                                     this guilty beetle\nIs a frightening thing\nWhen it shows its wings\nAnd leaps like the story of a woman who\n                                                     once in this house\nSaid the world was like a madhouse\n                                              cold winds blowing\nAnd life looks like some malignant disease,\nViewed from the heights of reason\nWhich I don't believe in\n                              I know the place\nTaken by tradition is like superstition\nAnd even what they call the\nLiterary leaves less for love\n                                    I know\nThe world is straight ice\nI know backwards the grief of life like chance\n                                                          if I can say that\nI can say easily I know you\n                                    like the progression\nFrom memory to what they call freedom\nOr reason\n             though it's not reason at all\nIt's an ideal like anarchism though it's not an ideal\nIt's a kind of time that has flown away from causes\nOr gotten loose from them, pried loose\nOr used them up, gotten away\n                                       no one knows why\nNothing happens\nThere is no reason, there's no dream\n                                               it's not inherited\nLike peace but it's not peace\n                                     there's no beginning\nLike religion but it is not God\nIt's more like middle age or humor\nWithout elucidation\n                         like greeting-card verse\nThis love is a recognized occasion\nI know you like I know my times\nAs if I were God and gave you birth\n                                               if I can say that\nI can say I am Ra who drew from himself\nTo give birth to Geb and Nut, Isis and Osiris\nThough it isn't decorous today to say this\n                                                     instead I say\nYou are the resource for my sense of decorum\nKnowing you as Ra knew the great of magic, \nHis imaginary wife, \n                         and without recourse to love\nMen and women are like tears\n                                       I would lose my memory, \nI would sleep twelve hours, I would wake up\nAnd get into my boat with my scribe,\nI would study the twelve hours of the day\nSpending an hour in each\n                                 I would have a secret name\nI would rush upon the guilty without pity\nTill the goddess of my eye in her vengeance\nOverwhelmed my own rage\n                                    as you and I take turns \nIn love's anger like the royal children\nBorn every morning to die that night\n                                                I know you speak\nAnd are as suddenly forgiven, \nIt's the consequence of love' having no cause\nThen we wonder what we can say\n                                            I can say\nI turn formally to love to spend the day,\nTo you to form the night as what I know, \nAn image of love allows what I can't say,\nSun's lost in the window and love is below\nLove is the same and does not keep that name\nI keep that name and I am not the same\nA shadow of ice exchanges the color of light,\nLove's figure to begin the absent night.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "For the Poem Paterson [1.
