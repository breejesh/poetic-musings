And the broad branches,<br />ice-sheathed early, may bear none. But still the woman<br />waits, with her ladder and sack, for something to break.<br />A gold, a lengthening of light. For the greens to burst<br />into something not unlike flame: the pale fruit<br />blushing over weeks through the furred cleft creases:<br />a freckling of blood. Then the hot, sweet scent<br />of August rot, drawing wasps and birds and children<br />through the month. So much abundance, and the only cost<br />waiting. Looking at the tree, I almost expect the sound of bells,<br />a stone church, sheep in flocks. But no sound of bells,<br />no clarion call. The church is far down in the valley.<br />This tree should be a revered thing, placed at the ancient<br />heart of a temple. Instead, it is on a common<br />lot, beside a road, apartment buildings, a dog<br />sleeping in its yard.\u00a0 The woman has come here<br />neither as master nor supplicant. She simply plans<br />to fill a plastic sack with whatever she can take:<br />the sweet meat giving under the press of a thumb,<br />covering what is its true fruit: the little pit, hard<br />and almond-brown that I\u2019ve scooped out,<br />palmed and planted, but to no avail. A better gardener<br />could make demands of such a seed, could train a tree<br />for what desire anticipates. But here the tree grows<br />only for itself. And if it bears no fruit for the killing<br />frost, or if it flowers late because of a too-warm winter,<br />what debt am I owed? At whose feet should I lay<br />disappointment? Delight no more comforting<br />nor wounding than hunger. The tree traffics<br />in a singular astonishment, its gold tongues<br />lolling out a song so rich and sweet, the notes<br />are left to rot upon the pavement. Is this the only religion<br />left to us? Not one only of mortification or desire,<br />not one of suffering, succor, not even of pleasure.<br />The juice of summer coils in the cells. It is a faith<br />that may not come to more than waiting.<br />To insist on pleasure alone is a mark<br />of childishness. To believe only in denial<br />the fool\u2019s prerogative. You hunger<br />because you hunger. And the tree calls to this.<br />But the fruit is real. I have eaten it. Have plucked<br />and washed and cut the weight, and stewed it<br />with sugar and lemon peel until the gold<br />ran rich and thick into jars. I have spooned it<br />over bread and meat. I have sucked it<br />from my husband\u2019s fingers. I have watched it sour<br />in its pots until a mist of green bubbled up<br />for a crust. I have gathered and failed it, as the tree<br />for me both ripens and fallows. But now, it is perhaps<br />too soon for fruit. The winter this year was hard,<br />the air full of smokes, and do I know if spring<br />reached the valley in time? Who planted this tree?<br />How long has it stood here? How many more years<br />can such a thing remain? The woman reaches a hand<br />up into the branches, palm cupped, weighing<br />the leaf knots. She is looking to see<br />what instincts, what weathers still grow here.<br />She snakes her hand through the greening branches.<br />Up from the valley, come the golden tongues of bells.</p> "}, {"title": "Central Avenue Beach", "view_node": "/poem/central-avenue-beach", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/adrian-matejka\" hreflang=\"und\">Adrian Matejka</a>", "field_date_published": "2016", "body": " <p>\u00a0</p><p><em>\u2014Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, 2016</em></p><p>\u00a0</p><p>1.</p><p>Just off of Highway 12, Sandburg\u2019s signature<br />of time &amp; eternity: the muggy marshes</p><p>&amp; thick forests of the mind, sand that sings<br />its memory of glaciers &amp; the glaciers before</p><p>them. 14,000 years of them.
