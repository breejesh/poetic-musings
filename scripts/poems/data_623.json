I drove toward it,\ninto the pass at Ironto, the dark\nnow deeper in the long steep grades,\nheavy in the shadow of mountains weighted\nwith evergreens, with spruce, pine,\nand cedar. How I wished to sleep\nin that sweet air, which filled--\nsuddenly over a rise--with the small\nlights of countless fireflies. Everywhere\nthey drifted, sweeping from the trees\ndown to the highway my headlights lit.\nFireflies blinked in the distance\nand before my eyes, just before\nthe windshield struck them and they died.\nCold phosphorescent green, on the glass\ntheir bodies clung like buds bursting\nthe clean line of a branch in spring.\nHow long it lasted, how many struck\nand bloomed as I drove on, hypnotic\nstare fixed on the road ahead, I can't say.\nBeyond them, beyond their swarming\nbright deaths came the rain, a shower\nwhich fell like some dark blessing.\nImagine when I flicked the windshield wipers on\nwhat an eerie glowing beauty faced me.\nIn that smeared, streaked light\ndiminished sweep by sweep you could have seen\nmy face. It was weary, shocked, awakened,\nalive with wonder far after the blades and rain\nswept clean the light of those lives\npassed, like stars rolling over\nthe earth, now into other lives.</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 623, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
