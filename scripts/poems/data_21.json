for telling his affairs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Because they could not tell their own so well,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They plagued the poet lord and made his life a hell.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They called him lewd, vile drunkard, vicious wight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And all because he dared to tell the truth,</span><br /><span

him, they hammered him forsooth;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Because he blended human with divine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They branded him \u201cthe bard of women and of wine.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Of course I soak the booze once in a while,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I don\u2019t wake the town to sing and shout it;</span><br

class=\"long-line\">And so the fools may never think to doubt it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When I declare I am a moral man,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As gifted, yet as good as
