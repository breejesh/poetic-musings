edge, the fall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into depth, the ascent</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">of light revelatory, the canyon walls moving</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">up out of</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">shadow, lit</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">colours of the layers cutting</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">down through darkness, sunrise as it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">passes a</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">precipitate of the river, its burnt tangerine </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">flare brief, jagged</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">bleeding above the far rim for a split</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">second I have imagined</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">you here with me, watching day's onslaught </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">standing in your bones\u2014they seem</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">implied in the record almost</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">by chance\u2014fossil remains held</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">in abundance in the walls, exposed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">by freeze and thaw, beautiful like a theory</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">stating who we are</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is carried forward by the X</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">chromosome down the matrilineal line </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">recessive and riverine, you like</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">me aberrant and bittersweet, and losing </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">your hair just when we have begun</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">to know the limits of beauty, you so </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">distant from me now but at ease</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">in a chair in your kitchen, pensive, mind </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">wandering away from yesterday's <em>Times</em>, the ink</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">rubbing off on your hands, dermatoglyphic </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and telltale, but unread</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">on the chair arms after you</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">had pushed yourself to your feet such</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">awhile ago, I'd say, for here I am </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">three hours behind you, riding the high</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Colorado Plateau as the opposing </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">continental plates force it over</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">a mile upward without buckling, smooth </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">tensed, muscular fundament, your bones yet</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">to be wrapped around mine\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">this will come later, when I return</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">to your place and time, I know it, you not </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">ready for past or future, our combined</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">bones so inconsequent yet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">personal, the geo</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">logic cross</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">section of the canyon dropping</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">from where I stand, hundreds</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">millions of shades of terra cotta, of copper</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">manganese and rust, the many varieties of stone\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">silt, sand, and slate, even \"green</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">river rock,\" a rough misidentified</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">fragment of it once unknowingly</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">dropped when I was a boy into my as of yet un </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">settled sediments by a man who tried</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">to explain how slowly the Earth meta </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">morphosed from my meagre</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Wolf Cub's collection of rocks, his sheer </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">casual physicality enough to negate</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">all received wisdom, my body voicing its immense </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">genetic imperatives, human</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">geology falling away</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into a</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">depth I am still unprepared for</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the canyon cutting down to</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the great unconformity, a layer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so named by the lack</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">of any fossil evidence to hypothesize</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">about and date such</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">a remote time by, at last no possible </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">retrospective certainties, what a</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">relief, your face illegible</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">these words when I began not what I had</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">intended to say\u2014something new about </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the natural dynamic between</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">earth and history, beauty and art\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but you are my subject, unavoidable</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and volatile, the canyon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">floor a mile from where I objectively</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">stand taking photos I will later develop of </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the ripe, trans</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">formative light on these surreal</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">buttes to show you on the surface</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">how beautiful and diverse</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and unimportant our time together</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">or with anyone else</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">really is\u2014</span></p>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 632, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663,
