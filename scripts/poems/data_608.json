boughs,-- \n                        Emerald twilights,-- \n                        Virginal shy lights, \nWrought of the leaves to allure to the whisper of vows, \nWhen lovers pace timidly down through the green colonnades \nOf the dim sweet woods, of the dear dark woods, \n  Of the heavenly woods and glades, \nThat run to the radiant marginal sand-beach within \n        The wide sea-marshes of Glynn;-- \nBeautiful glooms, soft dusks in the noon-day fire,-- \nWildwood privacies, closets of lone desire, \nChamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves,-- \nCells for the passionate pleasure of prayer to the soul that grieves, \nPure with a sense of the passing of saints through the wood, \nCool for the dutiful weighing of ill with good;-- \nO braided dusks of the oak and woven shades of the vine, \nWhile the riotous noon-day sun of the June-day long did shine \nYe held me fast in your heart and I held you fast in mine; \nBut now when the noon is no more, and riot is rest, \nAnd the sun is a-wait at the ponderous gate of the West, \nAnd the slant yellow beam down the wood-aisle doth seem \nLike a lane into heaven that leads from a dream,-- \nAy, now, when my soul all day hath drunken the soul of the oak, \nAnd my heart is at ease from men, and the wearisome sound of the stroke \n  Of the scythe of time and the trowel of trade is low, \n  And belief overmasters doubt, and I know that I know, \n  And my spirit is grown to a lordly great compass within, \nThat the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn \nWill work me no fear like the fear they have wrought me of yore \nWhen length was fatigue, and when breadth was but bitterness sore, \nAnd when terror and shrinking and dreary unnamable pain \nDrew over me out of the merciless miles of the plain,-- \nOh, now, unafraid, I am fain to face \n  The vast sweet visage of space. \nTo the edge of the wood I am drawn, I am drawn, \nWhere the gray beach glimmering runs, as a belt of the dawn, \n  For a mete and a mark \n    To the forest-dark:-- \n                        So: \nAffable live-oak, leaning low,-- \nThus--with your favor--soft, with a reverent hand, \n(Not lightly touching your person, Lord of the land!) \nBending your beauty aside, with a step I stand \nOn the firm-packed sand, \n                        Free \nBy a world of marsh that borders a world of sea. \n  Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the shimmering band \n  Of the sand-beach fastens the fringe of the marsh to the folds of the land. \nInward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and curl \nAs a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows \n    the firm sweet limbs of a girl. \nVanishing, swerving, evermore curving again into sight, \nSoftly the sand-beach wavers away to a dim gray looping of light. \nAnd what if behind me to westward the wall of the woods stands high? \nThe world lies east: how ample, the marsh and the sea and the sky! \nA league and a league of marsh-grass, waist-high, broad in the blade, \nGreen, and all of a height, and unflecked with a light or a shade, \nStretch leisurely off, in a pleasant plain, \nTo the terminal blue of the main. \nOh, what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea? \n  Somehow my soul seems suddenly free \nFrom the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin, \nBy the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn. \nYe marshes, how candid and simple and nothing-withholding and free \nYe publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea! \nTolerant plains, that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun, \nYe spread and span like the catholic man who hath mightily won \nGod out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain \nAnd sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain. \nAs the marsh-hen secretly builds on the watery sod, \nBehold I will build me a nest on the greatness of God: \nI will fly in the greatness of God as the marsh-hen flies \nIn the freedom that fills all the space 'twixt the marsh and the skies: \nBy so many roots as the marsh-grass sends in the sod \nI will heartily lay me a-hold on the greatness of God: \nOh, like to the greatness of God is the greatness within \nThe range of the marshes, the liberal marshes of Glynn. \nAnd the sea lends large, as the marsh: lo, out of his plenty the sea \nPours fast: full soon the time of the flood-tide must be: \nLook how the grace of the sea doth go \nAbout and about through the intricate channels that flow \n        Here and there, \n                        Everywhere, \nTill his waters have flooded the uttermost creeks and the low-lying lanes, \nAnd the marsh is meshed with a million veins, \nThat like as with rosy and silvery essences flow \n  In the rose-and-silver evening glow. \n                        Farewell, my lord Sun! \nThe creeks overflow: a thousand rivulets run \n'Twixt the roots of the sod; the blades of the marsh-grass stir; \nPasseth a hurrying sound of wings that westward whirr; \nPasseth, and all is still; and the currents cease to run; \nAnd the sea and the marsh are one. \nHow still the plains of the waters be! \nThe tide is in his ecstasy. \nThe tide is at his highest height: \n                        And it is night. \nAnd now from the Vast of the Lord will the waters of sleep \nRoll in on the souls of men, \nBut who will reveal to our waking ken \nThe forms that swim and the shapes that creep \n                        Under the waters of sleep? \nAnd I would I could know what swimmeth below when the

morning furnaces darker,\nJoy and success are exceptions. \n\nFour suggest a sadder surrender. \nPretence and cheaper influences are staining tender Pride there. \nSort out that little sink. \nWhy is the size of the baking remainder something that resembles \n     light more than cutting? \nThis cheese is more calm than anything solitary. \nIt is still an occasion for bottom anticipation. \nReason's season cracked that which was ripe. \nNearly all were neglected by blessing, not without nervous actions. \nHe's readily beginning to seed the cheese and estrange the Whites. \nThe celery curled its lashes at the slam. \nNot-so-heated reason will be little able to satisfy another. \nThis was formerly much used as a charming chair. \nPedestrianism showed itself triumphant and disagreeable. \nThat which was hidden worried them. \nThey asked that her speech be repeated. \nSummer light bears a likeness to justice. \nThen the light is supposing attention. \nThat section has a

/><span class=\"long-line\">Looking as if she were alive. I call</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That piece a wonder, now: Fr\u00e0 Pandolf's hands</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Worked busily a day, and there she stands.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Will 't please you sit and look at her? I said</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Fr\u00e0 Pandolf' by design, for never read</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strangers like you that pictured countenance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The depth and passion of its earnest glance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But to myself they turned (since none puts by</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How such a glance came there; so, not the first</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 't was not</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her husband's presence only, called that spot</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fr\u00e0 Pandolf chanced to say, 'Her mantle laps</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over my lady's wrist too much,' or 'Paint</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Must never hope to reproduce the faint</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Half-flush that dies along her throat:' such stuff</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For calling up that spot of joy. She had</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A heart\u2014how shall I say?\u2014too soon made glad,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sir, 't was all one! My favour at her breast,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The dropping of the daylight in the West,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><span class=\"long-line\">The bough of cherries some officious fool</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She rode with round the terrace\u2014all and each</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would draw from her alike the approving speech,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or blush, at least. She thanked men,\u2014good! but thanked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Somehow\u2014I know not how\u2014as if she ranked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This sort of trifling? Even had you skill</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In speech\u2014(which I have not)\u2014to make your will</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Quite clear to such an one, and say, 'Just this</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or there exceed the mark'\u2014and if she let</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2014E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Never to stoop. Oh, sir, she smiled, no doubt,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if alive. Will 't please you rise? We'll meet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The company below then.

Nay, we'll go</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Together down, sir.
