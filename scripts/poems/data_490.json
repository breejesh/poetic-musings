Sea, hill, and wood, \nThis populous village! Sea, and hill, and wood, \nWith all the numberless goings-on of life,\nInaudible as dreams! the thin blue flame\nLies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not;\nOnly that film, which fluttered on the grate,\nStill flutters there, the sole unquiet thing.\nMethinks, its motion in this hush of nature\nGives it dim sympathies with me who live, \nMaking it a companionable form,\nWhose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit\nBy its own moods interprets, everywhere\nEcho or mirror seeking of itself, \nAnd makes a toy of Thought.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But O! how oft,\nHow oft, at school, with most believing mind,\nPresageful, have I gazed upon the bars, \nTo watch that fluttering stranger! and as oft\nWith unclosed lids, already had I dreamt\nOf my sweet birthplace, and the old church-tower,\nWhose bells, the poor man's only music, rang\nFrom morn to evening, all the hot Fair-day, \nSo sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me\nWith a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear\nMost like articulate sounds of things to come!\nSo gazed I, till the soothing things I dreamt\nLulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams!\nAnd so I brooded all the following morn, \nAwed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye\nFixed with mock study on my swimming book:\nSave if the door half opened, and I snatched\nA hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up, \nFor still I hoped to see the stranger's face,\nTownsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved, \nMy playmate when we both were clothed alike!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dear babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,\nWhose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm, \nFill up the interspersed vacancies\nAnd momentary pauses of the thought!\nMy babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart\nWith tender gladness, thus to look at thee,\nAnd think that thou shalt learn far other lore\nAnd in far other scenes!

/><span class=\"long-line\">Images and memories</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From ruin or from ancient trees,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For I would ask a question of them all.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beyond that ridge lived Mrs. French, and once</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When every silver candlestick or sconce</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lit up the dark mahogany and the wine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A serving-man, that could divine</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That most respected lady's every wish,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ran and with the garden shears</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clipped an insolent farmer's ears</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And brought them in a little covered dish.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some few remembered still when I was young</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A peasant girl commended by a song,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who'd lived somewhere upon that rocky place,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And praised the colour of her face, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And had the greater joy in praising her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Remembering that, if

class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And certain men, being maddened by those rhymes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or else by toasting her a score of times,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose from the table and declared it right</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To test their fancy by their sight;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But they mistook the brightness of the moon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the prosaic light of day\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Music had driven their

the man who made the song was blind;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet, now I have considered it, I find</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That nothing strange; the tragedy began</span><br

fumbled to and fro</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And had but broken knees for hire</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And horrible splendour of desire;</span><br /><span

but the one card became</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A pack of hounds and not a pack of cards,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And that he changed into a hare.</span><br /><span

I have found an answer in those eyes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That are impatient to be gone;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Go therefore; but leave Hanrahan,</span><br /><span

A book transpires one letter and then one word at a time and nothing about reading can prevent this from happening. For this reason, books are best diluted or read over a good many years. Only things that are consumed endure beyond their shelf life. Nothing is really very different [if you say it] is. I had dinner yesterday at WD-50, which is a restaurant located where the new Fukienese area of Chinatown and the old pickle shops of the defunct Lower East Side almost come into alignment. The restaurant is at 50 Clinton Street and it has a post-Craftsman style d\u00e9cor with bulbous glass lamps that look like fluorescent flower bulbs. The chef's name is Wylie Dufresne. He is young and looks like a cowboy reincarnated as a skateboarder. His father Dewey is also a chef.</p><p>WD-50 is probably the only restaurant in Manhattan that makes you hallucinate the food you are eating while you are eating it. The food can be quite un-foodlike. I ate at the restaurant a few nights ago and afterwards my taste buds felt incongruous and ecstatic. I remember seeing something on another table that looked like dessert and I ordered it. A few moments later there were bonbon sized bits of pineapple on a plate. They had been soaked in something briny and had become pickles. Off to one side of the fruit was smeared what looked like hot fudge sauce except that it was made of ketchup and jalape\u00f1o peppers. The sauce was semi-frozen. The sauce was hot and cold and cold and hot I couldn't tell which. I put the pineapple in my mouth and it was like eating something that was once a vegetable. The chef had sprinkled some salt scented with what looked like dour chips of limes. It was not really necessary to eat the food; one could breathe it. When I put all this in my mouth I tasted so many things I forgot what was in my mouth. Eating at WD-50 is like reading Proust backwards. I looked over at a man at the table next to ours and he had the face of a six-year-old. The ideas of food erase the food itself and then become the food you did not think you were eating. Time passes inordinately or not at all. What is it like to eat an idea or its suggestion? As anyone who has eaten can tell you, the most beautiful memories are memories that one has forgotten how to have. Eating at WD-50 is like having psychoanalysis with a starch, a sugar, or a fat.</p> "}, {"title": "The Merchant of Venice, Act IV, Scene I [The quality of mercy is not strained]", "view_node": "/poem/merchant-venice-act-iv-scene-i-quality-mercy-not-strained", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-shakespeare\" hreflang=\"und\">William Shakespeare</a>", "field_date_published": "1600", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">The quality of mercy is not strained;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Upon the place beneath.
