to speak truth means to shine and<br />to burn,\u201d then I\u2019m a spent firework, blown-open, hollow, grime-<br />smeared and left for a wandering child\u2014to pick from<br />hardened sand, or to wash out to sea. I\u2019m so tired, and tired<br />of sitting on my hands. This morning I couldn\u2019t stop watching<br />a two-minute clip of a slow loris eating rice balls, lost in his<br />savoring of some inaudible tune. Or, maybe I should say I noted \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 how<br />his Gothic strangeling eyes rose to meet, then veer away, from<br />those unseen in the frame of one whose fingers offered the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0sticky white<br />grains. It was how his elegant hand curled from within<br />the box where he hid, and how his ease seemed to grow as he \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0chose<br />to lift each gleaming ball to his ready mouth. Only yes-<br />terday I learned of laws amended to let witnesses to executions \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 by<br />injection see, albeit over closed-circuit TV, the sterile affront<br />of IV-lines entering arms of inmates, though ID of injectors \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cwon\u2019t<br />be revealed.\u201d In most states, there\u2019s a 3-drug combo; the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 second\u2019s<br />a paralytic agent\u2026 Here, you get a one-step option, or the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 choice<br />to hang. Hanging? Does anyone choose to hang? The slow loris<br />again is reaching his dark plush arm toward me on the screen, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 and now<br />his tongue darts out in satisfaction, though perhaps I\u2019m \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 imposing<br />human emotion, and instinct makes him simply take care<br />of hygienic concerns. My people are mostly furred or plumed.<br />On death row, is hope a \u201cthing with feathers\u201d? Anesthetized,<br />I could watch the slow loris all day taking gifts from a stranger\u2019s<br />hand. The last time I saw my father, before he chose to leave<br />the country, he held the newspaper and a faceted glass jar<br />of raspberry jam toward me; and his hands quavered the way \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0hands<br />of the elderly do. Did he see this himself?\u00a0 Did he worry<br />about journeying south, despite frailty of shoulder, hip, the \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0haze<br />of continual pain? I wanted to say, <em>don\u2019t go</em>. I\u2019m still replaying<br />the loop of his shaking.
