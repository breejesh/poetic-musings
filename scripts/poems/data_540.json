It was the summer the only \n              woman known as a serial killer, a ten-dollar whore trolling\n\nthe plains of central Florida, said she knew she would\n       kill again, murder filled her dreams\n              and if she walked in the world, it would crack\n\nher open with its awful wings. It was the summer that in Texas, another\n       young woman killed her five children, left with too many\n              little boys, always pregnant. One Thanksgiving, she tried\n\nto slash her own throat. That summer the Congressman\n       lied again about the nature of his relations, or,\n              as he said, he couldn't remember if they had sex that last\n\nnight he saw her, but there were many anonymous girls that summer,\n       there always are, who lower their necks to the stone\n              and pray, not to God but to the Virgin, herself once\n\na young girl, chosen in her room by an archangel.\n       Instead of praying, that summer I watched television, reruns of\n              a UFO series featuring a melancholic woman detective\n\nwho had gotten cancer and was made sterile by aliens. I watched\n       infomercials: exercise machines, pasta makers,\n              and a product called Nails Again With Henna,\n\n<i>ladies, make your nails steely strong, <u>naturally</u></i>,\n       and then the photograph of Chandra Levy\n              would appear again, below a bright red number,\n\nsuch as 81, to indicate the days she was missing.\n       Her mother said, <i>please understand how we're feeling</i>\n              when told that the police don't believe she will be found alive,\n\nthough they searched the parks and forests\n       of the Capitol for the remains and I remembered\n              being caught in Tennessee, my tent filled with wind\n\nlifting around me, <i>tornado honey</i>, said the operator when I called\n       in fear. The highway barren, I drove to a truck stop where\n              maybe a hundred trucks hummed in pale, even rows\n\nlike eggs in a carton. Truckers paced in the dining room,\n       fatigue in their beards, in their bottomless\n              cups of coffee. The store sold handcuffs, dirty\n\nmagazines, t-shirts that read, <i>Ass, gas or grass.\n       Nobody rides for free</i>, and a bulletin board bore a \n              public notice: <i>Jane Doe, found in a refrigerator box\n\noutside Johnson, TN</i>, her slight measurements and weight.\n       The photographs were of her face, not peaceful in death,\n              and of her tattoos <i>Born to Run</i>, and <i>J.T.</i> caught in\n\nscrollworks of roses. One winter in Harvard Square, I wandered \n       drunk, my arms full of still warm, stolen laundry, and\n              a man said <i>come to my studio</i> and of course I went\u2014\n\nfor some girls, our bodies are not immortal so much as\n       expendable, we have punished them or wearied\n              from dragging them around for so long and so we go\n\nwearing the brilliant plumage of the possibly freed\n       by death. Quick on the icy sidewalks, I felt thin and\n              fleet, and the night made me feel unique in the eyes\n\nof the stranger. He told me he made sculptures\n       of figure skaters, not of the women's bodies,\n              but of the air that whipped around them,\n\na study of negative space,\n       which he said was the where-we-were-not\n              that made us. Dizzy from beer,\n\nI thought <i>why not step into\n       that space?</i> He locked the door behind me.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Field Note", "view_node": "/poem/field-note", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/eric-pankey\" hreflang=\"und\">Eric Pankey</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <pre>\nAn arctic, oblique light\u2014\nGrave, earthward\u2014\nRoughs in a snowfield's scoured basin,\n\nA curved pine-flecked horizon,\nAs if onto a province\nThe door of an Advent calendar\n\nOpened\u2014parenthetical\nWhispered as an aside,\nTallies and marginalia \n\nErased, yet readable still\nIn the sleet-lacquered gullies\nAnd scored rock,\n\nA province severed\nFrom the present,\nMarooned in the tectonic\n\nSlippage, in the stress \nFractures of the mythic.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Restless Ghost", "view_node": "/poem/restless-ghost", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/eric-pankey\" hreflang=\"und\">Eric Pankey</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <pre>\nThe wasp's paper nest hung all winter.\nSun, angled in low and oblique,\nBacklit\u2014with cold fever\u2014the dull lantern.\n\nEmptied, the dangled nest drew him:\nGray.
