unbound,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Come on the zephyr's wing,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And cheer the toiling clown.\n\nHappy as holiday-enjoying face,\nLoud tongued, and \"merry as a marriage bell,\"\nThy lightsome step sheds joy in every place;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And where the troubled dwell,\nThy witching charms wean them of half their cares;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And from thy sunny spell,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They greet joy unawares.\n\nThen with thy sultry locks all loose and rude,\nAnd mantle laced with gems of garish light,\nCome as of wont; for I would fain intrude,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And in the world's despite,\nShare the rude wealth that thy own heart beguiles;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If haply so I might\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Win pleasure from thy smiles.\n\nMe not the noise of brawling pleasure cheers,\nIn nightly revels or in city streets;\nBut joys which soothe, and not distract the ears,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That one at leisure meets\nIn the green woods, and meadows summer-shorn,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or fields, where bee-fly greets\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ear with mellow horn.\n\nThe green-swathed grasshopper, on treble pipe,\nSings there, and dances, in mad-hearted pranks;\nThere bees go courting every flower that's ripe,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On baulks and sunny banks;\nAnd droning dragon-fly, on rude bassoon,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attempts to give God thanks\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In no discordant tune.\n\nThe speckled thrush, by self-delight embued,\nThere sings unto himself for joy's amends,\nAnd drinks the honey dew of solitude.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There Happiness attends\nWith inbred Joy until the heart o'erflow,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of which the world's rude friends,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nought heeding, nothing know.\n\nThere the gay river, laughing as it goes,\nPlashes with easy wave its flaggy sides,\nAnd to the calm of heart, in calmness shows\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What pleasure there abides,\nTo trace its sedgy banks, from trouble free:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spots Solitude provides\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To muse, and happy be.\n\nThere ruminating 'neath some pleasant bush,\nOn sweet silk grass I stretch me at mine ease,\nWhere I can pillow on the yielding rush;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, acting as I please,\nDrop into pleasant dreams; or musing lie,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mark the wind-shaken trees,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And cloud-betravelled sky.\n\nThere think me how some barter joy for care,\nAnd waste life's summer-health in riot rude,\nOf nature, nor of nature's sweets aware.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When passions vain intrude,\nThese, by calm musings, softened are and still;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the heart's better mood\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feels sick of doing ill.\n\nThere I can live, and at my leisure seek\nJoys far from cold restraints\u2014not fearing pride\u2014\nFree as the winds, that breathe upon my cheek\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rude health, so long denied.\nHere poor Integrity can sit at ease,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And list self-satisfied\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The song of honey-bees.\n\nThe green lane now I traverse, where it goes\nNought guessing, till some sudden turn espies\nRude batter'd finger post, that stooping shows\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the snug mystery lies;\nAnd then a mossy spire, with ivy crown,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cheers up the short surprise,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And shows a peeping town.\n\nI see the wild flowers, in their summer morn\nOf beauty, feeding on joy's luscious hours;\nThe gay convolvulus, wreathing round the thorn,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agape for honey showers;\nAnd slender kingcup, burnished with the dew\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of morning's early hours,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like gold yminted new.\n\nAnd mark by rustic bridge, o'er shallow stream,\nCow-tending boy, to toil unreconciled,\nAbsorbed as in some vagrant summer dream;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who now, in gestures wild,\nStarts dancing to his shadow on the wall,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling self-gratified,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor fearing human thrall.\n\nOr thread the sunny valley laced with streams,\nOr forests rude, and the o'ershadow'd brims\nOf simple ponds, where idle shepherd dreams,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stretching his listless limbs;\nOr trace hay-scented meadows, smooth and long,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where joy's wild impulse swims\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one continued song.\n\nI love at early morn, from new mown swath,\nTo see the startled frog his route pursue;\nTo mark while, leaping o'er the dripping path,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His bright sides scatter dew,\nThe early lark that from its bustle flies,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To hail his matin new;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And watch him to the skies.\n\nTo note on hedgerow baulks, in moisture sprent,\nThe jetty snail creep from the mossy thorn,\nWith earnest heed, and tremulous intent,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Frail brother of the morn,\nThat from the tiny bent's dew-misted leaves\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Withdraws his timid horn,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And fearful vision weaves.\n\nOr swallow heed on smoke-tanned chimney top,\nWont to be first unsealing Morning's eye,\nEre yet the bee hath gleaned one wayward drop\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of honey on his thigh;\nTo see him seek morn's airy couch to sing,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until the golden sky\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bepaint his russet wing.\n\nOr sauntering boy by tanning corn to spy,\nWith clapping noise to startle birds away,\nAnd hear him bawl to every passer by\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To know the hour of day;\nWhile the uncradled breezes, fresh and strong,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With waking blossoms play,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And breathe \u00c6olian song.\n\nI love the south-west wind, or low or loud,\nAnd not the less when sudden drops of rain\nMoisten my glowing cheek from ebon cloud,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Threatening soft showers again,\nThat over lands new ploughed and meadow grounds,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Summer's sweet breath unchain,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And wake harmonious sounds.\n\nRich music breathes in Summer's every sound;\nAnd in her harmony of varied greens,\nWoods, meadows, hedge-rows, corn-fields, all around\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Much beauty intervenes,\nFilling with harmony the ear and eye;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While o'er the mingling scenes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Far spreads the laughing sky.\n\nSee, how the wind-enamoured aspen leaves\nTurn up their silver lining to the sun!\nAnd hark! the rustling noise, that oft deceives,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And makes the sheep-boy run:\nThe sound so mimics fast-approaching showers,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He thinks the rain's begun,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And hastes to sheltering bowers.\n\nBut now the evening curdles dank and grey,\nChanging her watchet hue for sombre weed;\nAnd moping owls, to close the lids of day,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On drowsy wing proceed;\nWhile chickering crickets, tremulous and long,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Light's farewell inly heed,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And give it parting song.\n\nThe pranking bat its flighty circlet makes;\nThe glow-worm burnishes its lamp anew;\nO'er meadows dew-besprent, the beetle wakes\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Inquiries ever new,\nTeazing each passing ear with murmurs vain,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As wanting to pursue\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His homeward path again.\n\nHark! 'tis the melody of distant bells\nThat on the wind with pleasing hum rebounds\nBy fitful starts, then musically swells\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O'er the dim stilly grounds;\nWhile on the meadow-bridge the pausing boy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Listens the mellow sounds,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And hums in vacant joy.\n\nNow homeward-bound, the hedger bundles round\nHis evening faggot, and with every stride\nHis leathern doublet leaves a rustling sound,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Till silly sheep beside\nHis path start tremulous, and once again\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Look back dissatisfied,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And scour the dewy plain.\n\nHow sweet the soothing calmness that distills\nO'er the heart's every sense its opiate dews,\nIn meek-eyed moods and ever balmy trills!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That softens and subdues,\nWith gentle Quiet's bland and sober train,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which dreamy eve renews\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In many a mellow strain!\n\nI love to walk the fields, they are to me\nA legacy no evil can destroy;\nThey, like a spell, set every rapture free\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That cheer'd me when a boy.\nPlay\u2014pastime\u2014all Time's blotting pen conceal'd,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Comes like a new-born joy,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To greet me in the field.\n\nFor Nature's objects ever harmonize\nWith emulous Taste, that vulgar deed annoys;\nWhich loves in pensive moods to sympathize,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And meet vibrating joys\nO'er Nature's pleasing things; nor slighting, deems\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pastimes, the Muse employs,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vain and obtrusive themes. \n\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "I&#039;d Like a Little Flashlight", "view_node": "/poem/id-little-flashlight", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/rachel-zucker\" hreflang=\"und\">Rachel Zucker</a>", "field_date_published": "2011", "body": " <style type=\"text/css\">\n<!--/*--><![CDATA[/* ><!--*/\n\np { line-height: 1.5em; }\nblockquote p { line-height: 1.5em; }\n/*--><!]]>*/\n</style><p>and I'd like to get naked and into bed and be hot radiating heat from the inside these sweaters and fleeceys do nothing to keep out the out or keep my vitals in\u2014some drafty body I've got leaking in and out in all directions I'd like to get naked into bed but hot on this early winter afternoon already dusky grim and not think of all the ways I've gone about the world and shown myself a fool, shame poking holes in my thinned carapace practically lacy and woefully feminine I'd like to get naked into bed and feel if not hot then weightless as I once was in the sensory deprivation tank in Madison, Wisconsin circa 1992 I paid money for that perfectly body-temperatured silent pitch dark tank to do what? play dead and not die? that was before email before children before I knew anything more than the deaths of a few loved ones which were poisoned nuts of swallowed grief but nothing of life of life giving which cuts open the self bursting busted unsolvable I'd like to get naked into the bed of my life but hot <i>hot</i> my little flicker-self trumped up somehow blind and deaf to all the dampening misery of my friends' woe-oh-ohs and I'd like a little flashlight to write poems with this lousy day not this poem I'm writing under the mostly flat blaze of bulb but a poem written with the light itself a tiny fleeting love poem to life hot hot hot a poem that would say \"oh look here a bright spot of life, oh look another!\"</p> "}], "pager": {"current_page": 463, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
