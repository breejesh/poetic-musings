If you looked closely,</p><p>you could make out silvery koi<br />swishing toward the clouded pond\u2019s edge</p><p>where a boy tugs at his mother\u2019s shirt for a quarter.<br />To buy fish feed. And watching that boy,</p><p>as he knelt down to let the koi kiss his palms,<br />I missed what it was to be so dumb</p><p>as those koi. I like to think they\u2019re pure,<br />that that\u2019s why even after the boy\u2019s palms were empty,</p><p>after he had nothing else to give, they still kissed<br />his hands. Because who hasn\u2019t done that\u2014</p><p>loved so intently even after everything<br />has gone? Loved something that has washed</p><p>its hands of you? I like to think I\u2019m different now,<br />that I\u2019m enlightened somehow,</p><p>but who am I kidding? I know I\u2019m like those koi,<br />still, with their popping mouths, that would kiss</p><p>those hands again if given the chance. So dumb.</p> "}, {"title": "Temptation of the Composer", "view_node": "/poem/temptation-composer", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/airea-d-matthews\" hreflang=\"en\">Airea D.
