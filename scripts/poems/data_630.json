Temptation hence away,\n   With all thy fatal train,\nNor once seduce my soul away,\n   By thine enchanting strain.\n\n              XIII.\n\nThrice happy they, whose heavenly shield\n   Secures their souls from harm,\nAnd fell Temptation on the field\n   Of all its pow'r disarms.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Tyger", "view_node": "/poem/tyger", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-blake\" hreflang=\"und\">William Blake</a>", "field_date_published": "1794", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Tyger!
