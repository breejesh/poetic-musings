side,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And where tents are pitch'd, and wherever you see south and south- east and south-west,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And along the shores, in mire (now fill'd over) came again and suddenly raged,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As eighty-five years agone no mere parade receiv'd with applause of friends,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But a battle which I took part in myself\u2014aye, long ago as it is, I took part in it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Walking then this hilltop, this same ground.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Aye, this is the ground,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rude forts appear again, the old hoop'd guns are mounted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I see the lines of rais'd earth stretching from river to bay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here we lay encamp'd, it was this time in summer also.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up his unsheath'd sword,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It glitter'd in the sun in full sight of the army.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Twas a bold act then\u2014the English war-ships had just arrived,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the transports swarming with soldiers.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A few days more and they landed, and then the battle.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Twenty thousand were brought against us,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A veteran force furnish'd with good artillery.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I tell not now the whole of the battle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But one brigade early in the forenoon order'd forward to engage the red-coats,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march'd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And how long and well it stood confronting death.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rais'd in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally to the General.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus' waters,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till of a sudden unlook'd for by defiles through the woods, gain'd at night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing their guns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy's mercy.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The General watch'd them from this hill,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It sickens me yet, that slaughter!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We fought the fight in detachments,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was against us,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back to the works on this hill,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">That and here my General's first battle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude with applause,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nobody clapp'd hands here then.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord off against us encamp'd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over their victory.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So dull and damp and another day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my General retreated.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I saw him at the river-side,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the last time.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Many no doubt thought of capitulation.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But when my General pass'd me,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I saw something different from capitulation.</span></p>\n<p><span

class=\"long-line\">The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept the enemy,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn!
