flame.</span></p><p>And while the smoke ascends above, breathe a prayer together,<br />That spirits of departed friends make peace beyond the river;<br />The Manitou\u2019s compassion seek, for he was sorely grieved,<br />Provide for the widows of the slain, that their needs be relieved.<br />If a stranger enters in your lodge, give him both food and bed,<br />E\u2019en if known to be your foe, no harm hangs o\u2019er his head,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">For now he is your honored guest, your protection he does claim;</span><br />Whate\u2019er your source of difference be, contest it on the plain.</p><p>The voice of the Great Spirit now is heard in every clime,<br />The rumblings of the thunder, the whisperings of the pine;<br />The works of the Great Spirit are seen on every hand,<br />Flowers, forests, mountains, stars, sun and even man.<br />The Lenape all should gather in the Autumn there to praise<br />The wonders of the Manitou, the goodness of his grace;<br />And they to tell the Nations what to them he has unbound,<br />And the way for them to reach the happy hunting-ground.</p><p><span class=\"long-line\">Once many thousand moons ago, in the synagogue there came</span><br />All the tribes and warriors from the forest, hill and plain;<br /><span class=\"long-line\">And while they were assembled there a young man rose to say,</span><br />The Manitou had shown him in a vision on that day<br />From afar a huge canoe with pinions spreading wide,<br />Coming o\u2019er the waters from across the sunrise side;<br />And in that huge canoe were people of strange dress,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">All were armed as warriors, though they peacefulness professed.</span></p><p>They told them of their God, \u201cwho came and died for men,\u201d<br /><span class=\"long-line\">And they were messengers from Him to save them from their sin,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But first, they said, they must have land, and thus a home prepare,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then they would teach them truth, and heaven with them share.</span><br />The young man to the warriors old his vision further told,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">And prophesied that from that day these tempters would grow bold;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That each would have a different creed, to teach a different tribe,</span><br />And when one told another each would think the other lied.</p><p>The young man for his people lamented loud and long;<br />He saw the friendship broken that always had been strong,<br />Dissension, war, and trouble, their happiness succeed,<br />Tribes rise against each other, their warriors die and bleed.<br /><span class=\"long-line\">At last, their faith all shattered, home, game and country gone,</span><br />Dejected, broken-hearted, he saw them westward roam.<br />The Manitou was sorrowful that they should faithless be,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cAnd now where is the heaven the stranger promised thee?\u201d</span></p><p>And some of the young warriors did live to see the day,<br />When across the sea from sunrise, with pinions flying gay,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came great canoes with strangers who soon did boldly land,</span><br />And with a friendly gesture, extended the right hand.<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Forgetful of the warning, they received them all as friends;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And made the sacred pledges to share with them their lands.</span><br />The Indians, true and faithful, their promise did fulfill,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">And eager sought the teachings of the white man\u2019s God and will.</span></p><p><span class=\"long-line\">And this recalls sweet memories of at least one truthful man;</span><br />He made and kept a promise in treating for our land;<br /><span class=\"long-line\">His deeds of loving-kindness strength to their teachings lend,</span><br />And sacred in our memory is the name of William Penn.<br />But alas! for faith and trusting, few others like him came,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">The white man\u2019s promised friendship, thenceforth we found was vain.</span><br />While noble were his teachings, his practice was deceit,<br />And thus the friends we trusted, our fondest hopes defeat.</p><p>And now the road is open across the stormy sea,<br />The strangers are invaders\u2014our friends no longer be!<br />Our Manitou is angry, their God hears not our cry,<br />On the bloody field of battle the noble warriors die.<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Again with peace and presents our friendship would be sought,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Requesting that our vengeance on some other tribe be brought.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And now for this protection and their proffered friendship-hand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The boasted Christian strangers ask to have as much more land.</span></p><p>Now many moons have passed, the Indians are but few;<br />For comments on the prophecy, I\u2019ll leave that all to you.<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is the white man still deceiving? Is the Indian being robbed?</span><br />Will he yet share his heaven and the teachings of his God?<br />The Indian was just a savage, but he would not lie and steal,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">The white man\u2019s highly civilized, but his conscience could not feel,</span><br />To rob poor, trusting Indians\u2014well, to him it was no sin,<br />And to break a solemn treaty was a very clever thing.</p><p><span class=\"long-line\">And when the Indian to the white man makes complaint about his land,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He is told with solemn gestures, \u201cSeek the Government\u2014not the man.\u201d</span><br />\u201cHe will be your good, great father and adopt you as his child,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">He knows better what you need, and will protect you all the while.\u201d</span><br />But the father was forgetful of his foster children\u2019s care,<br />So the Indian thus discouraged, finds relief not anywhere.<br />Will a Nation for its actions have to pass the judgment bar,<br />Or will God excuse the people, if the deeds the Nation\u2019s are?</p><p><span class=\"long-line\">He now sees the \u201cGood, Great Father,\u201d better known as \u201cUncle Sam,\u201d</span><br />Offering home, aid and protection to the poor of foreign lands;<br />Sees the foreigners in numbers seek his own beloved shore,<br />Where justice, love and liberty reign free forever more.<br />Sees the foreigners in Council, aid in making laws most just,<br />While he\u2019s no voice in legislation and his lands are held in trust,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you know a greater torture, or think his feelings can be guessed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he sees such freedom cherished, while his own rights are oppressed?</span></p><p>When on the day of judgment, their records there to see,<br />As God turns o\u2019er the pages, who will the braver be?<br />For one is just a savage, his simple faith applies;<br />The other one, a white man, very highly civilized.<br />And should they be together long enough to treat,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you suppose the white man the Indian there would cheat?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or if the chance is given, when the judgment\u2019s handed down,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would the white man take his heaven or the Indians\u2019 Hunting-Ground?</span></p><p>Do you think that Missionaries need be sent to foreign land,<br />To find fields for Christian duties and neglect the savage man?<br />In the land of peace and freedom can bondmen still be found?<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where every man does loudly boast class-legislation is not known!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Should neither one sit on the jury without the aid of ex-parte law,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Were the records brought from heaven, the court hear what the angels saw,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Have you doubts about the judgment? Would the white man pay the cost?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or would the heir by birthright learn that there his case was lost?</span></p><p>In this the Indian\u2019s version, can he still be justified,<br />Or was it for his poor sake, too, that Christ was crucified?<br />Will Christians stand by idly, nor lend a helping hand,<br />And by their silence justify the seizure of his land?<br />Or will their God from heaven hear the Indian\u2019s plea<br />And prompt the Christian people to lend him sympathy,<br />And through their earnest efforts, not sympathy alone,<br />Redeem the Nation\u2019s credit before the Judgment Throne?</p><p>Let the Indian have some duties, treat him as a worthy man,<br />Give him voice in the elections, give him title to his land,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Give him place of trust and honor, let him feel this yet his home,</span><br />Let him use his mind and muscle, let his actions be his own,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pay him what is justly due him, let your Government be his, too,</span><br />He will battle with each problem, just as faithfully as you.<br /><span class=\"long-line\">One who proves himself a warrior and of danger knows no fear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Surely can find ways to master each new problem that draws near.</span></p> "}, {"title": "To the American People", "view_node": "/poem/american-people", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/richard-calmit-adams\" hreflang=\"en\">Richard Calmit Adams</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <p>With your kind permission, your attention I will claim,<br />I am only just an Indian, it matters not my name,<br />But I represent my people, their cause and interest, too;<br />And in their name and honor, I present myself to you.<br />They have your sacred promise, your pledge of friendship warm,<br />That you would always aid them and protect them from all harm,<br />And in my humble efforts, as I briefly state their case,<br />Will you pardon my shortcomings, and my errors all erase?</p><p>I do not come with grandeur, or boast of any fame,<br />Rank in politics, society, or wealth I cannot claim,<br />I never went to college, have no title of LL.
