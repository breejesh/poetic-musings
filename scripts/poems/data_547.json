You know not,\nAnd that's the reason why you do\u2014or do not.\n\nBut what 's this to the purpose? you will say.\n  Gent. reader, nothing; a mere speculation,\nFor which my sole excuse is\u2014't is my way;\n  Sometimes with and sometimes without occasion\nI write what 's uppermost, without delay:\n  This narrative is not meant for narration,\nBut a mere airy and fantastic basis,\nTo build up common things with common places.\n\nYou know, or don't know, that great Bacon saith,\n  'Fling up a straw, 't will show the way the wind blows;'\nAnd such a straw, borne on by human breath,\n  Is poesy, according as the mind glows;\nA paper kite which flies 'twixt life and death,\n  A shadow which the onward soul behind throws:\nAnd mine 's a bubble, not blown up for praise,\nBut just to play with, as an infant plays.\n\nThe world is all before me\u2014or behind;\n  For I have seen a portion of that same,\nAnd quite enough for me to keep in mind;\u2014\n  Of passions, too, I have proved enough to blame,\nTo the great pleasure of our friends, mankind,\n  Who like to mix some slight alloy with fame;\nFor I was rather famous in my time,\nUntil I fairly knock'd it up with rhyme.\n\nI have brought this world about my ears, and eke\n  The other; that 's to say, the clergy, who\nUpon my head have bid their thunders break\n  In pious libels by no means a few.\nAnd yet I can't help scribbling once a week,\n  Tiring old readers, nor discovering new.\nIn youth I wrote because my mind was full,\nAnd now because I feel it growing dull.\n\nBut 'why then publish?'\u2014There are no rewards\n  Of fame or profit when the world grows weary.\nI ask in turn,\u2014Why do you play at cards?\n  Why drink? Why read?\u2014To make some hour less dreary.\nIt occupies me to turn back regards\n  On what I 've seen or ponder'd, sad or cheery;\nAnd what I write I cast upon the stream,\nTo swim or sink\u2014I have had at least my dream.\n\nI think that were I certain of success,\n  I hardly could compose another line:\nSo long I 've battled either more or less,\n  That no defeat can drive me from the Nine.\nThis feeling 't is not easy to express,\n  And yet 't is not affected, I opine.\nIn play, there are two pleasures for your choosing\u2014\nThe one is winning, and the other losing.\n\nBesides, my Muse by no means deals in fiction:\n  She gathers a repertory of facts,\nOf course with some reserve and slight restriction,\n  But mostly sings of human things and acts\u2014\nAnd that 's one cause she meets with contradiction;\n  For too much truth, at first sight, ne'er attracts;\nAnd were her object only what 's call'd glory,\nWith more ease too she 'd tell a different story.\n\nLove, war, a tempest\u2014surely there 's variety;\n  Also a seasoning slight of lucubration;\nA bird's-eye view, too, of that wild, Society;\n  A slight glance thrown on men of every station.\nIf you have nought else, here 's at least satiety\n  Both in performance and in preparation;\nAnd though these lines should only line portmanteaus,\nTrade will be all the better for these Cantos.\n\nThe portion of this world which I at present\n  Have taken up to fill the following sermon,\nIs one of which there 's no description recent.\n  The reason why is easy to determine:\nAlthough it seems both prominent and pleasant,\n  There is a sameness in its gems and ermine,\nA dull and family likeness through all ages,\nOf no great promise for poetic pages.\n\nWith much to excite, there 's little to exalt;\n  Nothing that speaks to all men and all times;\nA sort of varnish over every fault;\n  A kind of common-place, even in their crimes;\nFactitious passions, wit without much salt,\n  A want of that true nature which sublimes\nWhate'er it shows with truth; a smooth monotony\nOf character, in those at least who have got any.\n\nSometimes, indeed, like soldiers off parade,\n  They break their ranks and gladly leave the drill;\nBut then the roll-call draws them back afraid,\n  And they must be or seem what they were: still\nDoubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;\n  But when of the first sight you have had your fill,\nIt palls\u2014at least it did so upon me,\nThis paradise of pleasure and ennui.\n\nWhen we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,\n  Drest, voted, shone, and, may be, something more;\nWith dandies dined; heard senators declaiming;\n  Seen beauties brought to market by the score,\nSad rakes to sadder husbands chastely taming;\n  There 's little left but to be bored or bore.\nWitness those 'ci-devant jeunes hommes' who stem\nThe stream, nor leave the world which leaveth them.\n\n'T is said\u2014indeed a general complaint\u2014\n  That no one has succeeded in describing\nThe monde, exactly as they ought to paint:\n  Some say, that authors only snatch, by bribing\nThe porter, some slight scandals strange and quaint,\n  To furnish matter for their moral gibing;\nAnd that their books have but one style in common\u2014\nMy lady's prattle, filter'd through her woman.\n\nBut this can't well be true, just now; for writers\n  Are grown of the beau monde a part potential:\nI 've seen them balance even the scale with fighters,\n  Especially when young, for that 's essential.\nWhy do their sketches fail them as inditers\n  Of what they deem themselves most consequential,\nThe real portrait of the highest tribe?\n'T is that, in fact, there 's little to describe.\n\n'Haud ignara loquor;' these are Nugae, 'quarum\n  Pars parva fui,' but still art and part.\nNow I could much more easily sketch a harem,\n  A battle, wreck, or history of the heart,\nThan these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em,\n  For reasons which I choose to keep apart.\n'Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgarit\u2014'\nWhich means that vulgar people must not share it.\n\nAnd therefore what I throw off is ideal\u2014\n  Lower'd, leaven'd, like a history of freemasons;\nWhich bears the same relation to the real,\n  As Captain Parry's voyage may do to Jason's.\nThe grand arcanum 's not for men to see all;\n  My music has some mystic diapasons;\nAnd there is much which could not be appreciated\nIn any manner by the uninitiated.\n\nAlas! worlds fall\u2014and woman, since she fell'd\n  The world (as, since that history less polite\nThan true, hath been a creed so strictly held)\n  Has not yet given up the practice quite.\nPoor thing of usages! coerced, compell'd,\n  Victim when wrong, and martyr oft when right,\nCondemn'd to child-bed, as men for their sins\nHave shaving too entail'd upon their chins,\u2014\n\nA daily plague, which in the aggregate\n  May average on the whole with parturition.\nBut as to women, who can penetrate\n  The real sufferings of their she condition?\nMan's very sympathy with their estate\n  Has much of selfishness, and more suspicion.\nTheir love, their virtue, beauty, education,\nBut form good housekeepers, to breed a nation.\n\nAll this were very well, and can't be better;\n  But even this is difficult, Heaven knows,\nSo many troubles from her birth beset her,\n  Such small distinction between friends and foes,\nThe gilding wears so soon from off her fetter,\n  That\u2014but ask any woman if she'd choose\n(Take her at thirty, that is) to have been\nFemale or male? a schoolboy or a queen?\n\n'Petticoat influence' is a great reproach,\n  Which even those who obey would fain be thought\nTo fly from, as from hungry pikes a roach;\n  But since beneath it upon earth we are brought,\nBy various joltings of life's hackney coach,\n  I for one venerate a petticoat\u2014\nA garment of a mystical sublimity,\nNo matter whether russet, silk, or dimity.\n\nMuch I respect, and much I have adored,\n  In my young days, that chaste and goodly veil,\nWhich holds a treasure, like a miser's hoard,\n  And more attracts by all it doth conceal\u2014\nA golden scabbard on a Damasque sword,\n  A loving letter with a mystic seal,\nA cure for grief\u2014for what can ever rankle\nBefore a petticoat and peeping ankle?\n\nAnd when upon a silent, sullen day,\n  With a sirocco, for example, blowing,\nWhen even the sea looks dim with all its spray,\n  And sulkily the river's ripple 's flowing,\nAnd the sky shows that very ancient gray,\n  The sober, sad antithesis to glowing,\u2014\n'T is pleasant, if then any thing is pleasant,\nTo catch a glimpse even of a pretty peasant.\n\nWe left our heroes and our heroines\n  In that fair clime which don't depend on climate,\nQuite independent of the Zodiac's signs,\n  Though certainly more difficult to rhyme at,\nBecause the sun, and stars, and aught that shines,\n  Mountains, and all we can be most sublime at,\nAre there oft dull and dreary as a dun\u2014\nWhether a sky's or tradesman's is all one.\n\nAn in-door life is less poetical;\n  And out-of-door hath showers, and mists, and sleet,\nWith which I could not brew a pastoral.\n  But be it as it may, a bard must meet\nAll difficulties, whether great or small,\n  To spoil his undertaking or complete,\nAnd work away like spirit upon matter,\nEmbarrass'd somewhat both with fire and water.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Essay on Man, Epistle II", "view_node": "/poem/essay-man-epistle-ii", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/alexander-pope\" hreflang=\"und\">Alexander Pope</a>", "field_date_published": "1734", "body": " <pre>\n I.

Two principles in human nature reign;\nSelf-love to urge, and reason, to restrain;\nNor this a good, nor that a bad we call,\nEach works its end, to move or govern all\nAnd to their proper operation still,\nAscribe all good; to their improper, ill.\nSelf-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul;\nReason\u2019s comparing balance rules the whole.\nMan, but for that, no action could attend,\nAnd but for this, were active to no end:\nFixed like a plant on his peculiar spot,\nTo draw nutrition, propagate, and rot;\nOr, meteor-like, flame lawless through the void,\nDestroying others, by himself destroyed.\nMost strength the moving principle requires;\nActive its task, it prompts, impels, inspires.\nSedate and quiet the comparing lies,\nFormed but to check, deliberate, and advise.\nSelf-love still stronger, as its objects nigh;\nReason\u2019s at distance, and in prospect lie:\nThat sees immediate good by present sense;\nReason, the future and the consequence.\nThicker than arguments, temptations throng.\nAt best more watchful this, but that more strong.\nThe action of the stronger to suspend,\nReason still use, to reason still attend.\nAttention, habit and experience gains;\nEach strengthens reason, and self-love restrains.\nLet subtle schoolmen teach these friends to fight,\nMore studious to divide than to unite;\nAnd grace and virtue, sense and reason split,\nWith all the rash dexterity of wit.\nWits, just like fools, at war about a name,\nHave full as oft no meaning, or the same.\nSelf-love and reason to one end aspire,\nPain their aversion, pleasure their desire;\nBut greedy that, its object would devour,\nThis taste the honey, and not wound the flower:\nPleasure, or wrong or rightly understood,\nOur greatest evil, or our greatest good.\n\nIII.  Modes of self-love the passions we may call;\n\u2019Tis real good, or seeming, moves them all:\nBut since not every good we can divide,\nAnd reason bids us for our own provide;\nPassions, though selfish, if their means be fair,\nList under Reason, and deserve her care;\nThose, that imparted, court a nobler aim,\nExalt their kind, and take some virtue\u2019s name.\n   In lazy apathy let stoics boast\nTheir virtue fixed; \u2019tis fixed as in a frost;\nContracted all, retiring to the breast;\nBut strength of mind is exercise, not rest:\nThe rising tempest puts in act the soul,\nParts it may ravage, but preserves the whole.\nOn life\u2019s vast ocean diversely we sail,\nReason the card, but passion is the gale;\nNor God alone in the still calm we find,\nHe mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind.\n   Passions, like elements, though born to fight,\nYet, mixed and softened, in his work unite:\nThese, \u2019tis enough to temper and employ;\nBut what composes man, can man destroy?\nSuffice that Reason keep to Nature\u2019s road,\nSubject, compound them, follow her and God.\nLove, hope, and joy, fair pleasure\u2019s smiling train,\nHate, fear, and grief, the family of pain,\nThese mixed with art, and to due bounds confined,\nMake and maintain the balance of the mind;\nThe lights and shades, whose well-accorded strife\nGives all the strength and colour of our life.\nPleasures are ever in our hands or eyes;\nAnd when in act they cease, in prospect rise:\nPresent to grasp, and future still to find,\nThe whole employ of body and of mind.\nAll spread their charms, but charm not all alike;\nOn different senses different objects strike;\nHence different passions more or less inflame,\nAs strong or weak, the organs of the frame;\nAnd hence once master passion in the breast,\nLike Aaron\u2019s serpent, swallows up the rest.\n   As man, perhaps, the moment of his breath\nReceives the lurking principle of death;\nThe young disease that must subdue at length,\nGrows with his growth, and strengthens with his strength:\nSo, cast and mingled with his very frame,\nThe mind\u2019s disease, its ruling passion came;\nEach vital humour which should feed the whole,\nSoon flows to this, in body and in soul:\nWhatever warms the heart, or fills the head,\nAs the mind opens, and its functions spread,\nImagination plies her dangerous art,\nAnd pours it all upon the peccant part.\n   Nature its mother, habit is its nurse;\nWit, spirit, faculties, but make it worse;\nReason itself but gives it edge and power;\nAs Heaven\u2019s blest beam turns vinegar more sour.\n   We, wretched subjects, though to lawful sway,\nIn this weak queen some favourite still obey:\nAh!

into night,\n  Appears far off a mill the wind is turning,\n\nMethought that such a building then I saw;\n  And, for the wind, I drew myself behind\n  My Guide, because there was no other shelter.\n\nNow was I, and with fear in verse I put it,\n  There where the shades were wholly covered up,\n  And glimmered through like unto straws in glass.\n\nSome prone are lying, others stand erect,\n  This with the head, and that one with the soles;\n  Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts.\n\nWhen in advance so far we had proceeded,\n  That it my Master pleased to show to me\n  The creature who once had the beauteous semblance,\n\nHe from before me moved and made me stop,\n  Saying: \"Behold Dis, and behold the place\n  Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself.\"\n\nHow frozen I became and powerless then,\n  Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,\n  Because all language would be insufficient.\n\nI did not die, and I alive remained not;\n  Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,\n  What I became, being of both deprived.\n\nThe Emperor of the kingdom dolorous\n  From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;\n  And better with a giant I compare\n\nThan do the giants with those arms of his;\n  Consider now how great must be that whole,\n  Which unto such a part conforms itself.\n\nWere he as fair once, as he now is foul,\n  And lifted up his brow against his Maker,\n  Well may proceed from him all tribulation.\n\nO, what a marvel it appeared to me,\n  When I beheld three faces on his head!\n  The one in front, and that vermilion was;\n\nTwo were the others, that were joined with this\n  Above the middle part of either shoulder,\n  And they were joined together at the crest;\n\nAnd the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow;\n  The left was such to look upon as those\n  Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.\n\nUnderneath each came forth two mighty wings,\n  Such as befitting were so great a bird;\n  Sails of the sea I never saw so large.\n\n No feathers had they, but as of a bat\n  Their fashion was; and he was waving them,\n  So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.\n\nThereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.\n  With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins\n  Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.\n\nAt every mouth he with his teeth was crunching\n  A sinner, in the manner of a brake,\n  So that he three of them tormented thus.\n\nTo him in front the biting was as naught\n  Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine\n  Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.\n\n\"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,\"\n  The Master said, \"is Judas Iscariot;\n  With head inside, he plies his legs without.\n\nOf the two others, who head downward are,\n  The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;\n  See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.\n\nAnd the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.\n  But night is reascending, and 'tis time\n  That we depart, for we have seen the whole.\"\n\nAs seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,\n  And he the vantage seized of time and place,\n  And when the wings were opened wide apart,\n\nHe laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;\n  From fell to fell descended downward then\n  Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.\n\nWhen we were come to where the thigh revolves\n  Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,\n  The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,\n\nTurned round his head where he had had his legs,\n  And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,\n  So that to Hell I thought we were returning.\n\n\"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,\"\n  The Master said, panting as one fatigued,\n  \"Must we perforce depart from so much evil.\"\n\nThen through the opening of a rock he issued,\n  And down upon the margin seated me;\n  Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step.\n\nI lifted up mine eyes and thought to see\n  Lucifer in the same way I had left him;\n  And I beheld him upward hold his legs.\n\nAnd if I then became disquieted,\n  Let stolid people think who do not see\n  What the point is beyond which I had passed.\n\n\"Rise up,\" the Master said, \"upon thy feet;\n  The way is long, and difficult the road,\n  And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.\"\n\nIt was not any palace corridor\n  There where we were, but dungeon natural,\n  With floor uneven and unease of light.\n\n\"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,\n  My Master,\" said I when I had arisen,\n  \"To draw me from an error speak a little;\n\nWhere is the ice? and how is this one fixed\n  Thus upside down? and how in such short time\n  From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"Thou still imaginest\n  Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped\n  The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.\n\nThat side thou wast, so long as I descended;\n  When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point\n  To which things heavy draw from every side,\n\nAnd now beneath the hemisphere art come\n  Opposite that which overhangs the vast\n  Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death\n\nThe Man who without sin was born and lived.\n  Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere\n  Which makes the other face of the Judecca.\n\nHere it is morn when it is evening there;\n  And he who with his hair a stairway made us\n  Still fixed remaineth as he was before.\n\nUpon this side he fell down out of heaven;\n  And all the land, that whilom here emerged,\n  For fear of him made of the sea a veil,\n\nAnd came to our hemisphere; and peradventure\n  To flee from him, what on this side appears\n  Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.\"\n\nA place there is below, from Beelzebub\n  As far receding as the tomb extends,\n  Which not by sight is known, but by the sound\n\nOf a small rivulet, that there descendeth\n  Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed\n  With course that winds about and slightly falls.\n\nThe Guide and I into that hidden road\n  Now entered, to return to the bright world;\n  And without care of having any rest\n\nWe mounted up, he first and I the second,\n  Till I beheld through a round aperture\n  Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;\n\nThence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Inferno, Canto I", "view_node": "/poem/inferno-canto-i", "field_author": "<a

class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0On whose account the maid Camilla died,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Through every city shall he hunt her down,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0There from whence envy first did let her loose.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Therefore I think and judge it for thy best</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Who cry out each one for the second death;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And thou shalt see those who contented are</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Within the fire, because they hope to come,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0With her at my departure I will leave thee;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Because that Emperor, who reigns above,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0In that I was rebellious to his law,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Wills that through me none come into his city.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0There is his city and his lofty throne;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0O happy he whom thereto he elects!\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And I to him: \"Poet, I thee entreat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0By that same God whom thou didst never know,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0So that I may escape this woe and worse,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0And those thou makest so disconsolate.\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</span></p>\n"}], "pager":
