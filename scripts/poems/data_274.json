And the window within the eye,</p><p>which you don\u2019t see until you see, is white as a winter sky,<br />though you know it is joy that is held there.</p> "}, {"title": "Lesson VIII: Map of North America", "view_node": "/poem/lesson-viii-map-north-america", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/elizabeth-bradfield\" hreflang=\"und\">Elizabeth Bradfield</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <p>\u2014<em>redacted from </em>Smith\u2019s Quarto, or Second Book in Geography, <em>1848, p. 17</em></p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 division</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 division</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 general divisions</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 opposite<br />cluster\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 clusters\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What considerable number</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Where is<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where is Cape Farewell?</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>What sound leads into\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the largest</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What\u00a0 What\u00a0 What\u00a0 What</p><p>Boundaries\u00a0 Bound United\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bound<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 New\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bound\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 possessions?</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What\u00a0 What\u00a0 What\u00a0 What</p><p>prevails</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What\u00a0 What\u00a0 What\u00a0 What</p><p>races\u00a0 What\u00a0\u00a0 race\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ?</p> "}, {"title": "from American Amnesiac [Is it possible to let the sleeping life seep into day\u2014]", "view_node": "/poem/american-amnesiac-it-possible-let-sleeping-life-seep-day", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/diane-raptosh\" hreflang=\"en\">Diane Raptosh</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <p>Is it possible to let the sleeping life seep into day\u2014<br />that bright murk of softness, state of being reverently</p><p>at rest yet wide-eyed as Athena\u2019s wired owl?
