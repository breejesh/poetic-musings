class=\"long-line\">How often in the years that close,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When truce had stilled the sieging gun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The soldiers, mounting on their works,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With mutual curious glance have run</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From face to face along the fronting show,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And kinsman spied, or friend\u2014even in a foe.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">What thoughts conflicting then were shared,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While sacred tenderness perforce</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Welled from the heart and wet the eye;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0And something of a strange remorse</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rebelled against the sanctioned sin of blood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Christian wars of natural brotherhood.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then stirred the god within the breast\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The witness that is man's at birth;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A deep misgiving undermined</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each plea and subterfuge of earth;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They felt in that rapt pause, with warning rife,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Horror and anguish for the civil strife.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Of North or South they reked not then,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Warm passion cursed the cause of war:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Can Africa pay back this blood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Spilt on Potomac's shore?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet doubts, as pangs, were vain the strife to stay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And hands that fain had clasped again could slay.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">How frequent in the camp was seen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The herald from the hostile one,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A guest and frank companion there</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When the proud formal talk was done;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The pipe of peace was smoked even 'mid the war,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And fields in Mexico again fought o'er.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In Western battle long they lay</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So near opposed in trench or pit,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That foeman unto foeman called</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As men who screened in tavern sit:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"You bravely fight\"\u00a0each to the other said\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Toss us a biscuit!\"\u00a0o'er the wall it sped.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And pale on those same slopes, a boy\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A stormer, bled in noon-day glare;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No aid the Blue-coats then could bring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He cried to them who nearest were,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And out there came 'mid howling shot and shell</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A daring foe who him befriended well.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Mark the great Captains on both sides,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The soldiers with the broad renown\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They all were messmates on the Hudson's marge,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Beneath one roof they laid them down;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, free from hate in many an after pass,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strove as in school-boy rivalry of the class.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A darker side there is; but doubt</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In Nature's charity hovers there:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If men for new agreement yearn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then old upbraiding best forbear:<br />\n\"<em>The South's the sinner!</em>\" Well, so let it be;</span><br /><span>But shall the North sin worse, and stand the Pharisee?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">O, now that brave men yield the sword,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Mine be the manful soldier-view;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By how much more they boldly warred,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0By so much more is mercy due:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When Vicksburg fell, and the moody files marched out,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent the victors stood, scorning to raise a shout.</span></p>\n"}, {"title":
