sun and a moon&#13;\nand will the dead gather to watch them rise and set&#13;\n&#13;\nthen repair, each soul alone,&#13;\nto some ghastly equivalent of a bed.&#13;\nOr will the first night be the only night,&#13;\n&#13;\na darkness for which we have no other name?&#13;\nHow feeble our vocabulary in the face of death,&#13;\nHow impossible to write it down.&#13;\n&#13;\nThis is where language will stop,&#13;\nthe horse we have ridden all our lives&#13;\nrearing up at the edge of a dizzying cliff.&#13;\n&#13;\nThe word that was in the beginning&#13;\nand the word that was made flesh\u2014&#13;\nthose and all the other words will cease.&#13;\n&#13;\nEven now, reading you on this trellised porch,&#13;\nhow can I describe a sun that will shine after death?&#13;\nBut it is enough to frighten me&#13;\n&#13;\ninto paying more attention to the world\u2019s day-moon,&#13;\nto sunlight bright on water&#13;\nor fragmented in a grove of trees,&#13;\n&#13;\nand to look more closely here at these small leaves,&#13;\nthese sentinel thorns,&#13;\nwhose employment it is to guard the rose.</pre>&#13;\n "}, {"title": "The Parakeets", "view_node": "/poem/parakeets",
