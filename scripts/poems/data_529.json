\nMistaken long, I sought you then \nIn busy companies of men: \nYour sacred plants, if here below, \nOnly among the plants will grow; \nSociety is all but rude, \nTo this delicious solitude. \n\nNo white nor red was ever seen \nSo amorous as this lovely green; \nFond lovers, cruel as their flame, \nCut in these trees their mistress' name. \nLittle, alas, they know or heed, \nHow far these beauties hers exceed! \nFair trees! wheresoe'er your barks I wound \nNo name shall but your own be found. \n\nWhen we have run our passion's heat, \nLove hither makes his best retreat: \nThe gods who mortal beauty chase, \nStill in a tree did end their race. \nApollo hunted Daphne so, \nOnly that she might laurel grow, \nAnd Pan did after Syrinx speed, \nNot as a nymph, but for a reed. \n\nWhat wondrous life is this I lead! \nRipe apples drop about my head; \nThe luscious clusters of the vine \nUpon my mouth do crush their wine; \nThe nectarine and curious peach \nInto my hands themselves do reach; \nStumbling on melons as I pass, \nInsnared with flowers, I fall on grass.\n\nMeanwhile the mind, from pleasure less, \nWithdraws into its happiness: \nThe mind, that ocean where each kind \nDoes straight its own resemblance find; \nYet it creates, transcending these, \nFar other worlds, and other seas; \nAnnihilating all that's made \nTo a green thought in a green shade. \n\nHere at the fountain's sliding foot, \nOr at some fruit-tree's mossy root, \nCasting the body's vest aside, \nMy soul into the boughs does glide: \nThere like a bird it sits and sings, \nThen whets and combs its silver wings; \nAnd, till prepared for longer flight, \nWaves in its plumes the various light. \n\nSuch was that happy garden-state, \nWhile man there walked without a mate: \nAfter a place so pure and sweet, \nWhat other help could yet be meet! \nBut 'twas beyond a mortal's share \nTo wander solitary there: \nTwo paradises 'twere in one \nTo live in Paradise alone. \n\nHow well the skillful gard'ner drew \nOf flowers and herbs this dial new; \nWhere from above the milder sun \nDoes through a fragrant zodiac run; \nAnd, as it works, th' industrious bee \nComputes its time as well as we. \nHow could such sweet and wholesome hours \nBe reckoned but with herbs and flowers!</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Retreat", "view_node": "/poem/retreat", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/henry-vaughan\" hreflang=\"und\">Henry Vaughan</a>", "field_date_published": "1650", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Happy those early days, when I</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shin'd in my Angel-infancy!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Before I understood this place</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Appointed for my second race,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or taught my soul to fancy aught</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But a white celestial thought:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When yet I had not walk'd above</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A mile or two from my first Love,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And looking back\u2014at that short space\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Could see a glimpse of His bright face:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When on some gilded cloud, or flow'r,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My gazing soul would dwell an hour,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in those weaker glories spy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some shadows of eternity:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Before I taught my tongue to wound</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My Conscience with a sinful sound,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or had the black art to dispense</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A several sin to ev'ry sense,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But felt through all this fleshly dress</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bright shoots of everlastingness.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">O how I long to travel back,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And tread again that ancient track!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That I might once more reach that plain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where first I left my glorious train;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From whence th' enlightned spirit sees</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That shady City of Palm-trees.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But ah!
