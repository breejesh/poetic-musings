Maybe this should be in iambic pentameter,\nrather than this mock sestina, each line ending in a Penn\n\nvariant. I convinced myself the ticket to Baghdad was too expensive.\nI contemplated going as a human shield. I read, in open-\nmouthed shock, that your trip there was a $56,000 expenditure.\nIs that true? I watched you on Larry King Live\u2014his suspenders\nand tie, your open collar. You saw the war's impending\nmess. My husband gambled on my penumbra\n\nof doubt. <i>So you station yourself at a food silo in Iraq. What happens\nto me if you get blown up?</i> He begged me to stay home, be his Penelope.\nI sit alone in coach, but last night I sat with four poets, depending\non one another as readers, in a Pittsburgh caf\u00e9. I tried to be your pen\npal in 1987, not because of your pensive\nbad boy looks, but because of a poem you'd penned\n\nthat appeared in an issue of <i>Frank</i>. I still see the poet in you, Sean Penn.\nYou probably think fans like me are your penance\nfor your popularity, your star bulging into a pentagon\nfilled with witchy wanna-bes and penniless\npoets who waddle toward your icy peninsula\nof glamour like so many menacing penguins.\n\nBut honest, I come in peace, Sean Penn,\nwriting on my plane ride home. I want no part of your penthouse\nor the snowy slopes of your Aspen.\nI won't stalk you like the swirling grime cloud over Pig Pen.\nI have no script or stupendous\nnovel I want you to option. I even like your wife, Robin Wright Penn.\n\nI only want to keep myself busy on this flight, to tell you of four penny-\nloafered poets in Pennsylvania\nwho, last night, chomping on primavera penne\npasta, pondered poetry, celebrity, Iraq, the penitentiary\nof free speech. And how I reminded everyone that Sean Penn\nonce wrote a poem. I peer out the window, caress my lucky pendant:\n\nLook, Sean Penn, the clouds are drawn with charcoal pencils.\nThe sky is opening like a child's first stab at penmanship.\nThe sun begins to ripen orange, then deepen. </pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Peace That So Lovingly Descends", "view_node": "/poem/peace-so-lovingly-descends", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/noelle-kocot\" hreflang=\"und\">Noelle Kocot</a>", "field_date_published": "2009", "body": " <pre>\n\"You\" have transformed into \"my loss.\"\nThe nettles in your vanished hair\nRestore the absolute truth\nOf warring animals without a haven.\nI know, I'm as pathetic as a railroad\nWithout tracks.
