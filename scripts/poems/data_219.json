dyes,\nThe light for ever is morning light;\n     The hills are verdured pasture-wise;\nThe angel hosts with freshness go,\n    And seek with laughter what to brave;\u2014\nAnd binding all is the

earth.\nAnd the slant spirits trooping by\n     In streams and cross- and counter-streams\nCan but give ear to that sweet cry\n     For its suggestion of what dreams!\n\nAnd the more loitering are turned \n     To view once more the sacrifice\nOf those who for some good discerned\n     Will gladly give up paradise.\nAnd a white shimmering concourse rolls\n     Toward the throne to witness there\nThe speeding of devoted souls\n     Which God makes his especial care.\n\nAnd none are taken but who will,\n     Having first heard the life read out\nThat opens earthward, good and ill,\n     Beyond the shadow of a doubt;\nAnd very beautifully God limns,\n     And tenderly, life\u2019s little dream,\nBut naught extenuates or dims,\n     Setting the thing that is supreme. \n\nNor is there wanting in the press\n     Some spirit to stand simply forth,\nHeroic in its nakedness,\n     Against the uttermost of earth.\nThe tale of earth\u2019s unhonored things\n     Sounds nobler there than

would have by for friend,\n     The memory that he chose the life;\nBut the pure fate to which you go\n     Admits no memory of choice,\nOr the woe were not earthly woe\n     To which you give the assenting voice.\u2019\n\nAnd so the choice must be again,\n     But the last choice is still the same;\nAnd the awe passes wonder then,\n     And a hush falls for all acclaim.\nAnd God has taken a flower of gold\n     And broken it, and used therefrom\nThe mystic link to bind and hold \n     Spirit to matter till death come.\n\n\u2019Tis of the essence of life here,\n     Though we choose greatly, still to lack\nThe lasting memory at all clear,\n     That life has for us on the wrack\nNothing but what we somehow chose;\n     Thus are we wholly stripped of pride\nIn the pain that has
