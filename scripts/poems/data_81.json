The salted swastiks of their bodies, thick, rope-heavy, a scent you have to lift.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>My flesh-light cleaves their old energy eyes, slips each slit of limonite &amp; aperture.

They coil into their handless work of transmutation, into radio sensation, rattling the hair on my forearms.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>She recognizes me not as human but as her own imagination. I am granite reorganized, a formation\u2014: yet forming. I dream with the mountain because I am <em>of</em> the mountain.</p>\n\n<p>Grief for my elemental life respires my body. My snakes lick me from the wind like a chemical, return me to electric signal\u2014: a web of small lightning suturing the mouth to the skull. Pleasure, unlanguaged &amp; noise.</p>\n\n<p>I was dreamed into being\u2014: I was the dreamer. Skin fleshes the world it\u2019s made of, in overwhelm.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Cloud shadow drifts a gray whale across the salt flats\u2014: a periphery of white halite crust surrounds its slow shade. My lover crystallizes this same way along the ridges of my knuckles &amp; back of my hand, the dorsal side, as we also call a fin\u2014: I surfaced from deep submersion.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>There is no pleasure not earthen or wet. <em>Ancient ocean</em>, we say\u2014: &amp; we mean every body.</p>\n\n<p>Sand\u2019s gentle crust of berm edging the wash\u2014: the desert a hot pie, juiceless yet swelling mirage. The neon red sign of a jackrabbit\u2019s spine eaten to its glow, dropped from the sky, flickers in the bleach-light gushing the open land.</p>\n\n<p>How much love can a desert drink to bone? How many bodies\u2014: pressed beneath this tectonic pie?</p>\n\n<p>A shelled vehicle in landscape\u2014: rust-burning, slow bleed of oxide having laced the chassis, licked the light bucket to chrome edges.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A ram\u2019s scattered skeleton\u2014: empty lake of pelvis, desert grapevines threading the bone sockets, tugging the jaw vee deeper into the canyon. Its broken horn is a curl of gold telephone I hold to my eye. I am dislocated. Some knowledge is not mine, some is but I haven\u2019t arrived there yet.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>A long time ago the wind licked the coyote\u2019s skull to glass\u2014: this is how we happen. Atom-born, I bend back the atom world. My inheritance is hydrogen. How rain &amp; clouds happen to one another\u2014: wet though risen up from dust, abundant.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We have no word for God. It is sky because someone said it was. Until then, it was only what was in it: giant fish with pharyngeal teeth, orange sand clouds, &amp; \u2018Amo\u2014: the bighorn sheep made of stars &amp; staggered, spear still warm from the warrior\u2019s hand,\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>its shattered torso notching the night. The first wound was a clock, our hunger. We ate the mountain sheep\u2014: now our moon is a curve of cold fat congealing on a blued bone &amp; lives in daylight, diurnal leftover.</p>\n\n<p>Over night\u2019s black dunes we follow the trail of \u2018Amo\u2019s white face. If I speak of love\u2014: who will believe me? The only poets in this desert are beryl &amp; jasper.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Thunder is not thunder but the air broken by lighting. My lover backlit like a thunderhead, strapped with night until the softness of her hips disrupts\u2014: her light-wet hands &amp; cock. I am the sound I make breaking in a room.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>We are always becoming\u2014: from somewhere. Desire is a blood-colored worm flexing the sand sea around me. I have a power I am learning to be careful with.</p>\n\n<p>They say <em>When you see Numet, she\u2019s already been watching you</em>. The stroke her long tail drags in the sand disappears where the loose wash turns granite outcrop. Looning &amp; lonely, I thundercat\u2014: stalk myself through wind-flooded canyons, watch myself happen to me in the map of my hand.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning we didn\u2019t understand the bullet. It had no head, no arms or legs\u2014: <em>Menamentk</em> we said. It crossed the water. We named it \u2018Anya kwa\u2019oorny. We named it Of the Sun. We had no word for shore, except how water touches land.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>They gave us the word <em>shore</em> for their bullet to arrive on. Then said our flesh was also Shore\u2014: so we called the bullet <em>Bullet</em>. We name things for what is done there.</p>\n\n<p>The injuries of becoming human. Tuu\u2019achk\u2014: shoulder blades from turtle shell, hand from wing. The carpus erupting petals of wrist\u2014: bone-flower, flesh.</p>\n\n<p>Bats ripen like fruit in the lava fields, in volcanic caves of basalt. Dusk buds their breathing wings\u2014: flowering angel-beasts. The bats remember when we loved ourselves &amp; called so tenderly into twilight that our words brought us the throbbing world\u2014: mosquito &amp; blood. Kenakenem.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Even the eye\u2019s small water will evaporate to quench the sun. I search the rain from the tongues of my skin\u2014: it is four months away.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The horse has been dead in the dunes all summer. Sun-chromed ravens in early devotion opened each bright window along its bloated belly\u2014: unthreaded red curtains.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Desert as Plutonian shore\u2014: the torso open, a sand-torn sail of hide flapping above the funeral boat. In Mojave a horse is what it does &amp; how it does it, but our word for boat is a wooden box.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Mesquite pods drip in light from turquoise branches. Coyotes mistake the pool for moon water. If the shepherds don\u2019t poison the coyotes\u2014: the coyotes will eat the pods &amp; scat them out.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Scarification\u2014: the obligation of breaking, of rock &amp; whelm.</p>\n\n<p>Every scar loses its wound. In the valley of loss I shift shape, an ache\u2014: become one hundred coyotes in the \u2018analy grove weeping from every fleshed door of my body.</p>\n\n<p>The land of Death is a duned land. Xeric. Saly\u2019aay. Saly\u2019aat. <em>We burn our dead</em> we say\u2014: because we do. <em>Touch me</em> I say, because it\u2019s a story we become.</p>\n"}, {"title": "After the Winter Rain ", "view_node": "/poem/after-winter-rain", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/ina-coolbrith\" hreflang=\"en\">Ina Coolbrith</a>", "field_date_published": "1895", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">After the winter rain,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sing, robin!
