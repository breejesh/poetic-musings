But everything is getting choked to the point of\nSilence. Just now a magnetic storm hung in the swatch of sky\nOver the Fudds' garage, reducing it--drastically--\nTo the aura of a plumbago-blue log cabin on\nA Gadsden Purchase commemorative cover. Suddenly all is\nLoathing. I don't want to go back inside any more. You meet\nEnough vague people on this emerald traffic-island--no,\nNot people, comings and goings, more: mutterings, splatterings,\nThe bizarrely but effectively equipped infantries of \n   happy-go-nutty\nVegetal jacqueries, plumed, pointed at the little\nWhite cardboard castle over the mill run. \"Up\nThe lazy river, how happy we could be?\"\nHow will it end?

This wide, tepidly meandering, \nCivilized Lethe (one can barely make out the maypoles\nAnd <i>ch\u00e2lets de n\u00e9cessit\u00ea</i> on its sedgy shore) \n   leads to Tophet, that\nLandfill-haunted, not-so-residential resort from which\nSome travellers return! This whole moment is the groin\nOf a borborygmic giant who even now\nIs rolling over on us in his sleep. Farewell bocages,\nTanneries, water-meadows. The allegory comes unsnarled\nToo soon; a shower of pecky acajou harpoons is \nAbout all there is to be noted between tornadoes. I have\nOnly my intermittent life in your thoughts to live\nWhich is like thinking in another language. Everything\nDepends on whether somebody reminds you of me.\nThat this is a fabulation, and that those \"other times\"\nAre in fact the silences of the soul, picked out in \nDiamonds on stygian velvet, matters less than it should.\nProdigies of timing may be arranged to convince them\nWe live in one dimension, they in ours. While I\nAbroad through all the coasts of dark destruction seek\nDeliverance for us all, think in that language: its \nGrammar, though tortured, offers pavillions\nAt each new parting of the ways. Pastel\nAmbulances scoop up the quick and hie them to hospitals.\n\"It's all bits and pieces, spangles, patches, really; nothing\nStands alone. What happened to creative evolution?\"\nSighed Aglavaine. Then to her S\u00e9lysette: \"If his\nAchievement is only to end up less boring than the others, \nWhat's keeping us here? Why not leave at once?\nI have to stay here while they sit in there,\nLaugh, drink, have fine time. In my day\nOne lay under the tough green leaves,\nPretending not to notice how they bled into\nThe sky's aqua, the wafted-away no-color of regions supposed\nNot to concern us. And so we too\nCame where the others came: nights of physical endurance,\nOr if, by day, our behavior was anarchically\nCorrect, at least by New Brutalism standards, all then\nGrew taciturn by previous agreement. We were spirited \nAway <i>en bateau</i>, under cover of fudge dark.\nIt's not the incomplete importunes, but the spookiness\nOf the finished product. True, to ask less were folly, yet\nIf he is the result of himself, how much the better \nFor him we ought to be! And how little, finally, \nWe take this into account! Is the puckered garance satin\nOf a case that once held a brace of dueling pistols our \nOnly acknowledging of that color? I like not this,\nMethinks, yet this disappointing sequel to ourselves\nHas been applauded in London and St. Petersburg. Somewhere\nRavens pray for us.\" The storm finished brewing. And thus\nShe questioned all who came in at the great gate, but none\nShe found who ever heard of Amadis,\nNor of stern Aureng-Zebe, his first love. Some\nThey were to whom this mattered not a jot: since all\nBy definition is completeness (so\nIn utter darkness they reasoned), why not\nAccept it as it pleases to reveal itself? As when\nLow skyscrapers from lower-hanging clouds reveal\nA turret there, an art-deco escarpment here, and last perhaps\nThe pattern that may carry the sense, but\nStays hidden in the mysteries of pagination. \nNot what we see but how we see it matters; all's\nAlike, the same, and we greet him who announces\nThe change as we would greet the change itself. \nAll life is but a figment; conversely, the tiny\nTome that slips from your hand is not perhaps the \nMissing link in this invisible picnic whose leverage\nShrouds our sense of it. Therefore bivouac we \nOn this great, blond highway, unimpeded by\nVeiled scruples, worn conundrums. Morning is\nImpermanent. Grab sex things, swing up\nOver the horizon like a boy\nOn a fishing expedition. No one really knows\nOr cares whether this is the whole of which parts\nWere vouchsafed--once--but to be ambling on's\nThe tradition more than the safekeeping of it. This mulch for\nPlay keeps them interested and busy while the big,\nVaguer stuff can decide what it wants--what maps, what\nModel cities, how much waste space. Life, our\nLife anyway, is between. We don't mind \nOr notice any more that the sky <i>is</i> green, a parrot\nOne, but have our earnest where it chances on us, \nDisingenuous, intrigued, inviting more,\nAlways invoking the echo, a summer's day.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Freedom, Revolt, and Love", "view_node": "/poem/freedom-revolt-and-love", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/frank-stanford\" hreflang=\"und\">Frank Stanford</a>", "field_date_published": "1991", "body": " <pre>\nThey caught them.\nThey were sitting at a table in the kitchen.\nIt was early.\nThey had on bathrobes.\nThey were drinking coffee and smiling.\nShe had one of his cigarillos in her fingers.\nShe had her legs tucked up under her in the chair.\nThey saw them through the window.\nShe thought of them stepping out of a bath\nAnd him wrapping cloth around her.\nHe thought of her walking up in a small white building,\nHe thought of stones settling into the ground.\nThen they were gone.\nThen they came in through the back.\nHer cat ran out.\nThe house was near the road.\nShe didn't like the cat going out.\nThey stayed at the table.\nThe others were out of breath.\nThe man and the woman reached across the table.\nThey were afraid, they smiled.\nThe other poured themselves the last of the coffee.\nBurning their tongues.\nThe man and the woman looked at them.\nThey didn't say anything.\nThe man and the woman moved closer to each other,\nThe round table between them.\nThe stove was still on and burned the empty pot.\nShe started to get up.\nOne of them shot her.\nShe leaned over the table like a schoolgirl doing her lessons.\nShe thought about being beside him, being asleep.\nThey took her long gray socks\nPut them over the barrel of a rifle\nAnd shot him.\nHe went back in his chair, holding himself.\nShe told him hers didn't hurt much,\nLike in the fall when everything you touch\nMakes a spark.\nHe thought about her getting up in the dark\nWrapping a quilt around herself.\nAnd standing in the doorway.\nShe asked the men if they shot them again\nNot to hurt their faces.\nOne of them lit him one of his cigarettes.\nHe thought what it would be like\nBeing children together.\nHe was dead before he finished it.\nShe asked them could she take it out of his mouth.\nSo it wouldn't burn his lips.\nShe reached over and touched his hair.\nShe thought about him walking through the dark singing.\nShe died on the table like that,\nSmoke coming out of his mouth.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Believing in Iron", "view_node": "/poem/believing-iron", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/yusef-komunyakaa\" hreflang=\"und\">Yusef Komunyakaa</a>", "field_date_published": "1992", "body": "<pre>\nThe hills my brothers &amp; I created\nNever balanced, &amp; it took years\nTo discover how the world worked.\nWe could look at a tree of blackbirds\n&amp; tell you how many were there,\nBut with the scrap dealer\nOur math was always off.\nWeeks of lifting &amp; grunting\nNever added up to much,\nBut we couldn't stop\nBelieving in iron.\nAbandoned trucks &amp; cars\nWere held to the ground\nBy thick, nostalgic fingers of vines\nStrong as a dozen sharecroppers.\nWe'd return with our wheelbarrow\nGroaning under a new load, \nYet tiger lilies lived better\nIn their languid, August domain.\nAmong paper &amp; Coke bottles\nFoundry smoke erased sunsets,\n&amp; we couldn't believe iron\nLeft men bent so close to the earth\nAs if the ore under their breath\nWeighed down the gray sky.\nSometimes I dreamt how our hills\nWashed into a sea of metal,\nHow it all became an anchor\nFor a warship or bomber\nOut over trees with blooms\nToo red to look at.</pre>\n"}, {"title": "the great american yellow poem", "view_node": "/poem/great-american-yellow-poem", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/frances-chung\" hreflang=\"und\">Frances Chung</a>", "field_date_published": "2000", "body": " <pre>\nshe heard tales about saving grapefruit skins for cooking\nshe grew bright under the neon dragon of Chinatown\nshe made saffron curry rice for friends\nshe attended a barbecue in Amarillo, Texas\nshe stepped around yellow piss in snow\nshe cut herself on a Hawaiian pineapple\nshe learned to name forsythia where it grew\nvisions of ochre and citronella eluded her\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Page 22 / oh lucky me", "view_node": "/poem/page-22-oh-lucky-me", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/frances-chung\" hreflang=\"und\">Frances Chung</a>", "field_date_published": "2000", "body": " <pre>\noh lucky me\nI am of some use\nI am of some inspiration\nto the two men \nacross the lunchcounter\nI remind them of the\nlast Chinese restaurant\nthey took their family to\ndid you know that\nChinese food was delicious?</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Untitled [Sitting across from me on the bus a Chinese]", "view_node": "/poem/untitled-sitting-across-me-bus-chinese", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/frances-chung\" hreflang=\"und\">Frances Chung</a>", "field_date_published": "2000", "body": " <pre>\nSitting across from me on the bus a Chinese\ncouple and their young son.
