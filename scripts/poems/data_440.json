\nAs bugle-notes that, passing by, \n    In distance die away;\n\nAs leaving some grand waterfall, \n    We, lingering, list its roar\u2014 \nSo memory will hallow all \n    We've known, but know no more.\n\nNear twenty years have passed away \n    Since here I bid farewell \nTo woods and fields, and scenes of play, \n    And playmates loved so well.\n\nWhere many were, but few remain \n    Of old familiar things; \nBut seeing them, to mind again \n    The lost and absent brings.\n\nThe friends I left that parting day, \n    How changed, as time has sped! \nYoung childhood grown, strong manhood gray, \n    And half of all are dead.\n\nI hear the loved survivors tell \n    How nought from death could save, \nTill every sound appears a knell, \n    And every spot a grave.\n\nI range the fields with pensive tread, \n    And pace the hollow rooms, \nAnd feel (companion of the dead) \n    I'm living in the tombs.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "To Rosa", "view_node": "/poem/rosa", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/abraham-lincoln\" hreflang=\"und\">Abraham Lincoln</a>", "field_date_published": "1858", "body": " <pre>\nYou are young, and I am older;\n      You are hopeful, I am not\u2014\nEnjoy life, ere it grow colder\u2014\n      Pluck the roses ere they rot.\n\nTeach your beau to heed the lay\u2014\n      That sunshine soon is lost in shade\u2014\nThat <i>now's</i> as good as any day\u2014\n      To take thee, Rosa, ere she fade.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "August", "view_node": "/poem/august", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/algernon-charles-swinburne\" hreflang=\"und\">Algernon Charles Swinburne</a>", "field_date_published": "1904", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">There were four apples on the bough,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Half gold half red, that one might know</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The blood was ripe inside the core;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The colour of the leaves was more</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like stems of yellow corn that grow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through all the gold June meadow\u2019s floor.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The warm smell of the fruit was good</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To feed on, and the split green wood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With all its bearded lips and stains</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of mosses in the cloven veins,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Most pleasant, if one lay or stood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In sunshine or in happy rains.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There were four apples on the tree,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Red stained through gold, that all might see</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sun went warm from core to rind;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The green leaves made the summer blind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In that soft place they kept for me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With golden apples shut behind.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The leaves caught gold across the sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And where the bluest air begun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thirsted for song to help the heat;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As I to feel my lady\u2019s feet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Draw close before the day were done;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Both lips grew dry with dreams of it.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In the mute August afternoon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They trembled to some undertune</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of music in the silver air;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Great pleasure was it to be there</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till green turned duskier and the moon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Coloured the corn-sheaves like gold hair.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">That August time it was delight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To watch the red moons wane to white</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2019Twixt grey seamed stems of apple-trees;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A sense of heavy harmonies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grew on the growth of patient night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">More sweet than shapen music is.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But some three hours before the moon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The air, still eager from the noon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flagged after heat, not wholly dead;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Against the stem I leant my head;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The colour soothed me like a tune,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Green leaves all round the gold and red.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I lay there till the warm smell grew</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">More sharp, when flecks of yellow dew</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Between the round ripe leaves had blurred</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The rind with stain and wet;

But, O, what form of prayer\nCan serve my turn? <i>Forgive me my foul murder?</i>\nThat cannot be; since I am still possess'd \nOf those effects for which I did the murder,\u2014\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\nMay one be pardon'd and retain the offence? \nIn the corrupted currents of this world \nOffence's gilded hand may shove by justice; \nAnd oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself \nBuys out the law: but 'tis not so above: \nThere is no shuffling, there the action lies \nIn his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd, \nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults, \nTo give in evidence. What then? what rests? \nTry what repentance can: what can it not? \nYet what can it when one can not repent? \nO wretched state! O bosom black as death! \nO limed soul, that, struggling to be free, \nArt more engaged! Help, angels!

The golden sun, \nThe planets, all the infinite host of heaven, \nAre shining on the sad abodes of death, \nThrough the still lapse of ages.

All that breathe \nWill share thy destiny. The gay will laugh \nWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of care \nPlod on, and each one as before will chase \nHis favourite phantom; yet all these shall leave \nTheir mirth and their employments, and shall come, \nAnd make their bed with thee.
