I have never, however,\nseen any photograph of you, and am most curious\nto have an idea of your appearance, \nbeyond what my mirror, of course, tells me. \nThe cover of your <i>Collected Poems</i>\n(reproduced in the <i>Guardian</i>, November 1971)\nshows upwards of fifty faces; but which is yours? Are you\nthe little boy at the front, and if so have you\nchanged much since them?\n\nDear Mr Fisher recently while studying\nselections from a modern anthology with\none of my GCE groups I came across your interestingly titled\n'Starting to Make a Tree'. After the discussion I felt strongly\nyou were definitely <i>holding something back</i> in this poem\nthough I can't quite reach it.

Should we\narrange a rendezvous I'm afraid I wouldn't \nknow who to look out for as I've never unfortunately\nseen your photograph. But I notice you were born in 1930\nthe same year as Ted Hughes. Would I be right\nin expecting you to resemble <i>him</i>, more or less?\n\n                   --Dear Ms Tree,\nIt's true I'm in Rugby quite often, but the train\ngoes through without stopping. Could you fancy standing \noutside the UP Refreshment Room a few times so that\n<i>I</i> could learn to recognize <i>you</i>? If you could\njust get hold of my four books, and wave them,\nthen I'd know it was you. As for my own appearance\nI suppose it inclines more to the \nPhilip Larkin side of Ted Hughes's looks. . .\nSee if you think so as I go by. . .\n\nDear Mr Fisher I have been commissioned\nto write a short\ncritical book on your work\nbut find that although I have a full\ndossier of reviews etcetera\nI don't have access to your books. Libraries\nover here seem just not to have bought them in. \nSince the books are quite a few years old now\nI imagine they'll all have been remaindered\nsome while back? Or worse, pulped? So can\nyou advise me on locating second-hand copies,\nnot too expensively I hope? Anyway,\nyours, with apologies and respect. . .\n\nDear Mr Fisher I am now\nso certain I am you that it is obvious to me\nthat the collection of poems I am currently working on\n          must be\n<i>your own next book!</i> Can you let me know--\nwho is to publish it and exactly when \nit will be appearing? I shouldn't like there to \nbe any trouble over contracts, 'plagiarism'\netcetera; besides which it would be a pity\nto think one of us was wasting time and effort.\nHow far have <i>you</i> got?
