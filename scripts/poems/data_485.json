S. Eliot\n\n\nInstead of the usual welcoming sign to greet you\nThere's the brute statement: <i>This is Lagos</i>.\nIf you make it to the island\u2014if you make your way\nAcross the bridge and past the floating slums\nAnd sawmills and the steaming garbage dumps, the auto yards\nStill burning with spilled fuel and to your final destination\nAt the end of a long tracking shot, all of it on fire\u2014\nYou come face-to-face with hell: the pandemonium \nOf history's ultimate bazaar, a breathing mass\nWhose cells are stalls crammed full of spare parts, \nChains, detergents, DVDs; where a continuous cacophony\nOf yells and radios and motorcycles clogs the air.\nThey arrive from everywhere, attracted by the promise\nOf mere possibility, by the longing for a different kind of day\nHere in the city of scams, by a hope that quickly comes to nothing.\nTo some it's a new paradigm, \"an announcement of the future\"\nWhere disorder leads to unexpected patterns, unimagined opportunities\nThat mutate, blossom, and evolve. To others it's the face of despair.\nThese are the parameters of life, a life doled out in quarters, \nIn the new, postmodern state of nature: garbage and ground plastic\nAnd no place to shit or sleep; machetes, guns, and e-mails\nSent around the world from Internet caf\u00e9s; violence and chaos\nAnd a self-effacing sprawl that simply makes no sense\nWhen seen from ground zero, yet exhibits an abstract beauty \nWhen seen from the air\u2014which is to say, not seen at all.\n\nAcross the ocean and a century away a culture died.\nThe facts behind the Crow's whole way of life\u2014the sense \nOf who and what they were, their forms of excellence and bravery\nAnd honor\u2014all dissolved, and their hearts \"fell to the ground,\nAnd they could not lift them up again. After this nothing happened\"\n(Plenty Coups), meaning nothing they could do made any sense, \nBeyond the fact of biological survival. It's easy to forget\nHow much of ordinary life, of what we value, long for, and recall\u2014\nAmbition, admiration, even poetry\u2014rests on things we take for granted,\nAnd how fragile those things are. \"I am trying to live a life I do not understand,\"\nA woman said, when the buffalo and the coups they underwrote were gone.\nThey could have tried to cope. Instead they found their solace\nIn an indeterminate hope, a hope for a future they couldn't yet imagine,\nWhere their ways of life might somehow reemerge in forms\nOf which they couldn't yet conceive, or even begin to understand.\nIt was a dream of a different life, a life beyond the reservation\nWithout any tangible location, predicated on a new idea of the good\nWith no idea of what it was, or what achieving it might mean\u2014\nLike listening to a song with no sound, or drawing an imaginary line\nIn the imaginary sand in an imaginary world without boundaries.\n\nIt feels compelling, and I even think it's true. But these are things\nI've only read about in magazines and book reviews, and not experienced,\nWhich was Plato's point\u2014that poets don't know what they talk about.\nIt doesn't matter though, for most of what we think of as our lives\nIs lived in the imagination, like the Crows's inchoate hope, or the fantasies\nOf those who leave a village in the country for the city in the smoke. \nAnd when I look in <i>my</i> imagination for the future, it isn't hope and restoration\nThat I find but smoldering tires and con men in a world of megacities\nAnd oil fields, where too much has been annexed to be restored.\nI have the luxury of an individual life that has its own trajectory and scope\nWhen taken on its terms\u2014the terms I chose\u2014however unimportant it might seem\nFrom the vantage point of history or the future. What scares me is the thought\nThat in a world that isn't far away this quaint ideal of the personal \nIs going to disappear, dissolving in those vast, impersonal calculations\nThrough which money, the ultimate abstraction, renders each life meaningless, \nBy rendering the forms of life that make it seem significant impossible. \n<i>Face me I face you</i>: packed into rooms with concrete beds\nAnd not a trace of privacy, subsisting on contaminated water, luck, \nAnd palm-wine gin, with lungs scarred from the burning air, \nThese are the urban destitute, the victims of a gospel of prosperity\nUntouched by irony or nostalgia\u2014for how can you discover\nWhat you haven't felt, or feel the loss of things you've never known?\nI write because I can: talking to myself, composing poems\nAnd wondering what you'll make of them; shoring them\nAgainst the day our minor ways of life have finally disappeared\nAnd we're not even ghosts. Meanwhile life regresses\nTowards the future, death by death. You to whom I write, \nOr wish that I could write long after my own death, \nWhen it's too late to talk to you about the world you live in, \nThis is the world you live in: This is Lagos.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Chester", "view_node": "/poem/chester", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/john-koethe\" hreflang=\"und\">John Koethe</a>", "field_date_published": "2009", "body": " <pre>\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wallace Stevens is beyond fathoming, he is so strange; it\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0is as if he had a morbid secret he would rather perish than\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0disclose . . . \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014Marrianne Moore to William Carlos Williams\n\n\nAnother day, which is usually how they come:\nA cat at the foot of the bed, noncommittal\nIn its blankness of mind, with the morning light\nSlowly filling the room, and fragmentary\nMemories of last night's video and phone calls.\nIt is a feeling of sufficiency, one menaced\nBy the fear of some vague lack, of a simplicity\nOf self, a self without a soul, the nagging fear\nOf being someone to whom nothing ever happens.\nThus the fantasy of the narrative behind the story,\nOf the half-concealed life that lies beneath\nThe ordinary one, made up of ordinary mornings\nMore alike in how they feel than what they say. \nThey seem like luxuries of consciousness, \nLike second thoughts that complicate the time\nOne simply wastes.
