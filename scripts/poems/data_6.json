whom you may know</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the name of Annabel Lee;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And this maiden she lived with no other thought</span><br

sow with love and reap with thanksgiving. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And he is your board and your fireside.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 For you come

its flood also. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Seek him always with hours to live. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 For it is his to fill your need but not your emptiness. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And in the
