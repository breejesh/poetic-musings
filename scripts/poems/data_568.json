some churls at our mirth repine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Round your foreheads garlands twine,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drown sorrow in a cup of wine,\n\u00a0\u00a0And let us all be merry.\n\nNow all our neighbors' chimnies smoke,\n\u00a0\u00a0And Christmas blocks are burning;\nTheir ovens they with baked meats choke,\n\u00a0\u00a0And all their spits are turning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without the door let sorrow lie,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if for cold it hap to die,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We'll bury it in a Christmas pie,\n\u00a0\u00a0And evermore be merry.\n\nNow every lad is wondrous trim,\n\u00a0\u00a0And no man minds his labor;\nOur lasses have provided them\n\u00a0\u00a0A bagpipe and a tabor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Young men and maids, and girls and boys,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Give life to one another's joys;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And you anon shall by their noise\n\u00a0\u00a0Perceive that they are merry.\n\nRank misers now do sparing shun,\n\u00a0\u00a0Their hall of music soundeth;\nAnd dogs thence with whole shoulders run,\n\u00a0\u00a0So all things aboundeth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The country-folk themselves advance,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For crowdy-mutton's come out of France;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Jack shall pipe and Jill shall dance,\n\u00a0\u00a0And all the town be merry.\n\nNed Swatch hath fetched his bands from pawn,\n\u00a0\u00a0And all his best apparel;\nBrisk Nell hath bought a ruff of lawn\n\u00a0\u00a0With droppings of the barrel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And those that hardly all the year\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had bread to eat or rags to wear,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Will have both clothes and dainty fare,\n\u00a0\u00a0And all the day be merry.\n\nNow poor men to the justices\n\u00a0\u00a0With capons make their errands;\nAnd if they hap to fail of these,\n\u00a0\u00a0They plague them with their warrants.\n\u00a0\u00a0But now they feed them with good cheer,\n\u00a0\u00a0And what they want they take in beer,\n\u00a0\u00a0For Christmas comes but once a year,\n\u00a0\u00a0And then they shall be merry.\n\nGood farmers in the country nurse\n\u00a0\u00a0The poor, that else were undone;\nSome landlords spend their money worse,\n\u00a0\u00a0On lust and pride at London.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There the roisters they do play,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drab and dice their land away,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which may be ours another day;\n\u00a0\u00a0And therefore let's be merry.\n\nThe client now his suit forbears,\n\u00a0\u00a0The prisoner's heart is eased;\nThe debtor drinks away his cares,\n\u00a0\u00a0And for the time is pleased.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Though others' purses be more fat,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why should we pine or grieve at that;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hang sorrow, care will kill a cat,\n\u00a0\u00a0And therefore let's be merry.\n\nHark how the wags abroad do call\n\u00a0\u00a0Each other forth to rambling;\nAnon you'll see them in the hall,\n\u00a0\u00a0For nuts and apples scrambling;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hark how the roofs with laughters sound,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anon they'll think the house goes round;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For they the cellar's depths have found,\n\u00a0\u00a0And there they will be merry.\n\nThe wenches with their wassail-bowls\n\u00a0\u00a0About the streets are singing;\nThe boys are come to catch the owls,\n\u00a0\u00a0The wild mare in is bringing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our kitchen boy hath broke his box,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And to the dealing of the ox\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our honest neighbors come by flocks,\n\u00a0\u00a0And here they will be merry.\n\nNow kings and queens poor sheep-cotes have,\n\u00a0\u00a0And mate with everybody;\nThe honest now may play the knave,\n\u00a0\u00a0And wise men play at noddy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some youths will now a mumming go,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some others play at rowland-hoe,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And twenty other gameboys moe;\n\u00a0\u00a0Because they will be merry.\n\nThen wherefore in these merry days\n\u00a0\u00a0Should we, I pray, be duller?\nNo, let us sing some roundelays\n\u00a0\u00a0To make our mirth the fuller.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And whilst we thus inspired sing,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let all the streets with echoes ring;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Woods, and hills, and everything\n\u00a0\u00a0Bear witness we are merry. </pre>\n<p>\u00a0</p> "},

years before,\nHad pushed the concept in his <i>Total War</i>,\nAnd so it seemed a perfect time to see\nIf one could undermine an enemy\nBy striking its civilian population.\nThis proved a most effective innovation,\nAs the defenseless ancient Basque town learned:\nThree quarters of its buildings bombed and burned,\nIts children and young wives were blown to bits\nOr gunned down, when they fled, by Messerschmitts.\nShocked condemnations poured forth from the press,\nBut Franco triumphed; and, buoyed by success,\nThe Luftwaffe would similarly slam\nWarsaw and Coventry and Rotterdam.\n\nBerlin cheered these developments; but two\nCan play such games\u2014and usually do\u2014\nNo matter how repellent or how bloody.\nAnd Churchill was, as always, a quick study\nAnd would adopt the tactic as his own,\nSending the RAF to blitz Cologne.\nDevising better ways to carpet-bomb\t\t\t\t\n (Which later were employed in Vietnam),\nThe Allies, in a show of aerial might,\nIncinerated Dresden in a night\nThat left the good and evil to their fates,\nWhile back in the untorched United States\nOthers approved an even darker plan\nTo coax a prompt surrender from Japan.\n\nThat day in Spain has taught us, to our cost,\nThat there are lines that never should be crossed;\nThe ignorance of leaders is not bliss\nIf they\u2019re intent on tempting Nemesis.\nEach day we rise, and each day life goes on:\nAn author signs beneath a colophon;\nTrucks carry freight through waves of desert heat;\nA bat cracks, a crowd rises to its feet;\nHuge jets lift to the sky, and, higher yet,\nFloat satellites that serve the Internet.\nBut still, despite our cleverness and love,\nRegardless of the past, regardless of\nThe future on which all our hopes are pinned,\nWe\u2019ll reap the whirlwind, who have sown the wind.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Herb Garden", "view_node": "/poem/herb-garden", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/timothy-steele\"

prevent them with thy humble ode,  \nAnd lay it lowly at his bless\u00e8d feet; \nHave thou the honour first thy Lord to greet,  \n\u00a0\u00a0And join thy voice unto the Angel Quire,  \nFrom out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire.  \n\n\nThe Hymn\n\nI\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the winter wild,  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 While the heaven-born child \n\u00a0\u00a0 All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies;

Big tears\nare eyes' response\nto a dawn chill, first frost.\nClang of empty bottles in a paper sack.\nThe boulevard was a kind of free verse,\nbig noun skyscrapers, until the freeway\nblew out the margin.  Baseball cap \nwith the bill worn to the side or back.\nSteam pours plume-like\nfrom the roof of the new\nsenior tower.  Thus lawn-sprinklers\nsweep the air.  This wool hat\nitchy on your forehead, those\nmysterious white sores\nthat dot the mouth.\nNew boots with Leather-Plus uppers\nand waffler stomper soles.  The way\ngas stations dwindled overnight,\nnow go the banks: people\nhuddle in the rain\nas close as they can to the wall\nlined up for the automated teller.\nBut I just want to snuggle.\nJumping the curb on my skateboard.  Even\nbefore the war was over, vets\nbegan to fill the J.C.s on the GI bill,\nmen playing rummy on the quad at lunch.\nThe way street folk make the sidewalk their bench.\nTaking my glasses off, sensing\nthe muscles in the eye\nflex as they refocus.  Cars\nat a stop light, each with its own\nlone rider.  Standing on the bus,\nusing both hands to hold on.\nThe sun in the trees still,\nslowly rising.  Beeper on a belt.\nThe container inverted\nshall never be repeated, fungus\nin a hot tub.  A swamp entitled\nStanley Marsh.  Black spot\non the thumbnail is permanent.\nNeo-social democrat sneaks back\ninto Lenin closet.  Not\ndemocratic socialist.  Folding chair\ntriangulates space.  Shirt collar\nas mock root for neck's trunk.\nSmall physical detail\nenlarged (enraged)\nrefocuses the whole room\nin the midst of the banquet.\nRetrofit theory to text.\nThe idea of a doorstop\nextends the wall.  Thin palms kept trim\nalong commercial strip.  Hollow is as\ngarbage truck sounds.  Ghetto barber:\nshop behind bars.  Ask bus driver\nto call out destination.\nChapped Lip Alert.\nMan on a park bench\nintent over crossword.\nThe sound of a piano\nhung over the courtyard.  Bliss\napproximates emotional state.\nGay nerds (complex style).  Drunk\non the streetcorner snaps to attention,\nsalutes the slow-cruising black-and-white.\nOld manikin in used clothing store,\ncheeks chipped, nose missing.  Bin\nof loose sneakers in front of shoe shop.\nDreams prod you with their skewed\npertinence.  Like fingering around\nin your pocket for a nickel, an\nambiguous coin, with your gloves on.\nThe pom-pom girl is sucking on a kiwi\nas the sun rises, little startled bird.\nCarved into nice pink slices, art\nhistory is served\non seaweed-wrapped balls of rice.\nAt the checkout stand, the bagger\nhooks the plastic sack into its wire\nmould, dropping in the brown\nspotted bananas before\nthe bottles of cider.\nThe close-out sale of\nfiction at Dalton's\nfails to attract \nafficionados from their new\nimproved \"ring\" frisbees.\nPlease don't call it xerox.\nJust because it rhymes.  An absence\nof form is pictured\non a milk carton.  The dumpsters\nare ripe.  The present tense\ncalls up a terrific nostalgia\nforeshadowing antacids.\nCan you explain why Ezra Pound\nand Ty Cobb were never,\nnot once, photographed\nin the same room together?\nThe way cryotechnology\naccounts for the Rolling Stones.\nHeads of cauliflower\nwrapped in plastic.  Half moon rising\nin the red dusk sky, streetlamps on\nilluminating nothing.  Twisting\nthe orange on\nthe glass juice squeezer.\nBefore dawn, alone\nin the supermarket parkinglot,\nhosing it down.  Van's awning\nsignals catering truck.  A leaf\nhad fallen onto the damp cement,\nits image sharp years after.\nOld green Norton anthology\nperfect for doorstop.  Albino mulatto's\ncuriously blonde hair.  Linebreak muted\nsays I'm a normal guy.  To generalize\na detail (use of plurals)\nentails violence.  Body language\nat staff meeting very stiff.\nBirds scatter high over\na schoolyard (asphalt\nbaseball diamond).  My own breath\ninstead of a lung.  Offhand,\nby comments hidden in the brain,\nwe reiterate an old refrain.\nMy mind instead of an onion.\nThat these 20 year olds\ncall their shared housing\na commune seems quaint.\nOld black woman with a cane\nstruggles to pull herself\nonto the bus.  I strain\nto see these words.  Chronicle\nof Higher Medication.  Learning\nthat I can't pick my nose when\nI read, because the gesture\nbumps my glasses.  Our program is\ncompromise all positions\nat all points, radical\nat the cash bar.  The colon swells\nwhile the dash is but a double\nhyphen.  Thus paint freckles\nan old ladder.  Hair, combed\nfrom the part, over the large\nbald dome, barely throws\nstrands of a shadow.  Men huddle\npredawn in the vacant lot\nfor the grey trucks\nthat will carry them out\ninto the valley, hot day\nharvesting crops.  Yuppie world\nwhere everyone's successful, everyone's\nwhite.  This guy's got great pecs,\nstrong deltoids, tight\nabdominals, but through one nipple --\nsmall gold safety pin.  This poem,\n15 lines of free verse, defining\n(and as if \"as spoken to\") a noun\nnaming a common household object\nhas been designed\nto compete successfully for space\nagainst cartoons in the <i>New Yorker</i>.\nMan striding down the street,\nwhistling loudly.  Now that soft drinks\ncome in boxes.  The Gift of \nSecurity, the lock with 1,000\npersonal combinations: the only\nlock in the world that let's you\nset your own combination and change it\nanytime, in seconds, without tools.\nBecause friends were coming over\nfor dinner, they began to think\nabout cooking in the early afternoon.\nThe honey in the 5 gal. can\nhad begun to crystallize, so she\nput it in the oven to heat up.\nThen a neighbor phoned (the details\nhere are less certain) and they\nwent over to smoke some dope\nthat had just been purchased.\nThis state expands one's sense\nof time, of the moment.  To be\nwithin the present can be\ntotally sensuous.  When they returned\nlater, the honey can had exploded,\ntearing off the oven door.\nBoiling honey (it was just like\nnapalm) clung to the ceiling,\nfloor and walls.  </pre>\n "}, {"title": "Albany", "view_node": "/poem/albany", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/ron-silliman\" hreflang=\"und\">Ron Silliman</a>", "field_date_published": "1983", "body": " <pre>\n                    <i>For Cliff Silliman</i></pre>\n<p>If the function of writing is to \"express the world.\" My father withheld child support. forcing my mother to live with her parents. my brother and I to be raised together in a small room.
