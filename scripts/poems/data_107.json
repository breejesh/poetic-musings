Pleasure.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We drank a beer that was fresh on the tongue\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in a new way. Light. Almost carbonated. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They said they were concerned </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">about me and my relationship to poetry. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the afternoon sun, as the breeze blew softly, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I first protested to them not about poetry,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but about poets. Their nationalism, their acquiescence\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but also their facebook and twitter accounts. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their brags and their minor attacks, their politics. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their prizes and their publications. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their democratic party affiliations. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I said to them I\u2019m not concerned\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">about my relationship to poetry </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">which regularly felt to me like that moment\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">when you open your app and there are a bunch </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of mentions and you haven\u2019t posted anything a while </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and all you can do is say today is so FML and start to work through them. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This is not the same as the oh no way of the Berkeley farmer\u2019s market brawl, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">not the state burning and burning again, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but still, how to write an epiphanic possibility in this sociality? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I had written for so long about being together,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">about how we were together like it or not. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I had used a metaphor of breath and of space. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I had embraced the epiphanic\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">not just at the end of the poem, as was the lyric convention, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but sometimes I even made the whole poem epiphanic. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And that I couldn\u2019t do anymore. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lately there wasn\u2019t any singing that I could hear.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Just attempts. Dark times.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nothing about this terrible moment was new though. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It has always been a terrible moment. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And there have always been poets too. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And always poets writing the terrible nation into existence. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This is one reason I will never get a tramp stamp that says </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">poetry is my boyfriend. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">^ </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I thought for a while there were two sorts of poets. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Poets who write the terrible nation into existence </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and poets screwing around doing something else. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For years I was on team poets screwing around doing something else. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For years I had used poetry to slip away,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">elude the hold of the family, the coupleform, the policing of tradition,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to pry open time into an endless stretch of possibility. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In that room where we try to pry open possibility. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When I first heard the avant garde\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I heard it as an opening. A door. A window, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Maybe a garage door. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A hole in the wall I could shimmy through. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I heard it as an opening. All sorts of openings. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I could make the hole.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or my pink crowbar could. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I would be writing and I would fall into the singing, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That whoosh. The singing whoosh. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And because at first I saw myself as someone who wanted </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">an opening in the tradition, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I split this whoosh up all the time.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I fragmented it into words or took away its deictics. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Another friend, a poet, who no longer talks to me\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">once gave me the image of the pink crowbar\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as a way of thinking about writing.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Losing her was a loss all around.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But to compensate for that loss\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I think often about pulling something open. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Although I\u2019m fairly convinced she would grab\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the pink crowbar out of my hand if she saw me wielding it. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For years, there was that perfect moment after the reading </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">where we had to leave the bar because\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the couples were coming to buy their cocktails\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and we couldn\u2019t figure out where to go. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Maybe it was Friday or Saturday night and all the bars </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">were full of people who were not talking about poetry </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so we kept walking, looking in each bar and each one wrong. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Eventually the streets opened up and we were at the bridge </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and there was a river and we walked across the open space to it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and climbed down its sides and sat there.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We had bought some beers and a small glass flask of whiskey from a bodega. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We carried the cans and the flask in brown bags as a convention. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But we did not need this convention.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If there was law, the law drove by, didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Other things were. Night. Maybe moon. Water. Rats. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes drugs were involved. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We walked through Wall Street at 3 am and\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">we rattled the locked doors of all the buildings, laughing </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">at their absurdity because we knew where it was at </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and at was rattling the doors.\u00a0 </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">^ </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">During these days, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I would wake up and my head would hurt\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and then I would realize that in my dream\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I had said to myself that I should write some poetry. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But my dreams never explained to me why.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or how. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How to sing in these dark times? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is true that I have been with poetry for a long time.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since I was a teenager. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Those loves of many years and our bodies changing together. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And yet also the deepening of this love. Despite. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That day with the breeze in the bar </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And we said together, there needs\u00a0to be some pleasure in the world.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And next, poetry is the what is\u00a0left of life. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And we pledged, more singing. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And we referenced by saying, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the dark times.\u00a0Will there also be singing?\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yes, there will also be singing. About the dark times. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">^ </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At night I thought if I just read all of Brecht,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I would maybe find the singing. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I began to read Brecht that night,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in bed with my son while he too read before he went to sleep. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There was a new edition.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was hard to hold because it was so big. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I rested it on a pillow and I rested my head on a pillow </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and I turned the pages looking for the singing. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I couldn\u2019t find the singing. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After I started reading Brecht,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I began sorting through my books. I had too many.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As I pulled them off the shelves, blew off the dust, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I asked myself would I need it if there was a revolution. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It turned out that I thought I would for sure need </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">five translations of the Odyssey </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and all the books of Susan Howe. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I kept all the plant books too. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The comfort of the Jespen Manual of Vascular Plants of California. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It\u2019s an open question if the revolution will still need poetry, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">its tradition and its resistance to that tradition. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But it will for sure need the Vascular Plants of California. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">^ </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It\u2019s always been a terrible moment. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But now I understand it as even more terrible. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The nation is for sure not my boyfriend. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the land it claims, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">though I don\u2019t claim it, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I hold my love for this land on my underside,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in a small pocket that eventually bursts to release my love spores. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I mean it is not a casual love.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is though a difficult one. Threatened. Invaded. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A friend is dying </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as the scotch broom is putting out its nitrogen fixing roots </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but our friendship died years before\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the seed pods open explosively </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">another friend has cancer </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and last for eighty years </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and yet another friend now in the world in some new way </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but they are hard and survive rough transport through water </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and mainly it was all the information\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">fleshy and full of proteins in a way that interests ants\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">we suddenly knew about everything </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as the ants carry the seeds back to their nests creating dense infestations.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A mixture of hell. A metaphor of resilience. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The scotch broom has so many tricks. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grows in patches and as scattered individuals </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with a total cover of about 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As does the Tree of Heaven. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There is no space too polluted for it.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It absorbs sulfur dioxide in its leaves. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It can withstand cement dust and fumes from coal tar operations,\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as well as resist ozone exposure relatively well.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Even mercury.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It grows fast, and even faster in California. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And once it starts, it shows up everywhere, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">impossible to destroy. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Loves the fires. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Everything. Never ending. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Everything. Yet to come. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And yet the world and the leaves continue to exist.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yellow veins. Flowers. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Large, compound leaves.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Arranged. Alternately on the stem. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">11-33 leaflets. Occasionally up to 41. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One to three teeth on each side. Close to the base.\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Everything. Small. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yellow-green to reddish. Flowers. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Everything.

The origin of the word <em>hybrida</em> is Latin, from <em>ibrida</em>, or \u2018mongrel\u2019\u2014a creature of mixed breeds. Open interpretation of violence, collision of selves, histories, and languages. Is language a movement of spirits or bodies making themselves known through their outward mutation? My parents came from China and migrated to Taiwan, ultimately arriving in the U.S. I was born in America, contributing to a long line of mixed culture, crossed boundaries, the collaborative and combustible nature of words. If I grew up with dual language, dual identity, how can anything feel both one and unified?<br />\n\u00a0<br />\nThe fragmentation of the zuihitsu welcomes me randomness, collage, a piecing (and piercing) of memory and imagination that adds up to feeling akin to liberation. The liberation of imagination is the body\u2019s response to dominance and containment. To build, speak, and write a way through each darkness. Zuihitsu, erasure, re-imagined ekphrastic poems, words in movement, journalism in conversation with invented narrative, fairy tales fused with the lyric imagination, language in dialogue with visual art\u2014much of it isn\u2019t entirely new, but now, written with a singular hand, calls to me. I think of discomfort, creating spaces where one is uneasy in order to change.\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0<br />\nImmigrant body, female body, mother body.<br />\nIs the creative body inherently vulnerable?<br />\nDamaged body. Dream body. Fluid body. Boy body.</p>\n<p>\u02dc\u00a0</p>\n<p>During a recent panel discussion about hybrid forms at Sarah Lawrence College Aracelis Girmay described the present generation, as made up of not two arms, but many appendages, like octopuses. She was careful not to say octopi. That wasn\u2019t quite the word she envisioned as she held out her arms as if to touch something multi-limbed, iridescent.\u00a0</p>\n<p>In the same discussion, Rachel Zucker said, \u201cMotherhood is a hybrid form and there haven\u2019t been enough discussions about this language.\u201d This utterance struck me: lexicon of mother, collage of maternal self, fusion of artistic forms made manifest through the lens of protection. But this language is often ignored, buried, dismissed or dismantled. Mangled by teeth. An entire landscape of language.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Raising a boy who is black and Asian in this country, I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that I never truly confronted the full spectrum of race in my past, at least not enough. Race was never a vessel but a land that bled into the tide. It surged, carried me forward, and then I arrived at my body. I try not to cast my own identity aside to understand my son\u2019s. Sometimes, I feel that old self fading away. I attempt to hang on and let go at once. Sometimes, when the room is populated, I search the borders for my own disappearance.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyone who has ever been born of mixed race feels this inheritance. Often, gestured as an in-between state, it\u2019s unlike having one foot in one territory or another. Anyone who has been born of several races, cultures, reaches for a bottomless depth. I sit before a large scale illustration made into a postcard. It\u2019s a detail from a children\u2019s book by Jostein Gaarder called <em>Questions Asked</em>. The illustration by Akin Duzakin shows a self and what seems to be a shadow-self diving into the depths of water. It feels like this: questions with no end. If one lives within this feeling, it doesn\u2019t provide comfort but being. The diving down does not come without breathlessness: Fathomless foundation of questions, and a wooden trunk filled with more gleaming questions.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Perhaps there is a world down there.</p>\n<p>\u02dc\u00a0</p>\n<p>By raising a boy, do I understand what it means to live as a black boy? How do I speak of his existence without appropriating his existence? I return to the language of mothers.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n\u02dc<br />\n\u00a0<br />\nAt a reading, I spoke about giving birth and raising a black son. I was told that someone in the audience Googled, \u201cTina Chang and Black Son.\u201d I don\u2019t think anyone will find any information anywhere about this except in my poems. It\u2019s not Google-able, Google searched or defined: My son found within a search engine. When he was born, our mutual exhaustion was a hybrid sound.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Media can obliterate a spirited word (world).\u00a0</p>\n<p>I am not the same person I was yesterday and form allows me to speak this fact.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\n&amp;<br />\n\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0<br />\nMy longest poem focuses on a boy rising from his beginnings in the womb and living in a body made vulnerable by authorities. There are clippings, diagrams, evidence that speak toward the poems that surround them. The fragmented form like zuihitsu has a place here. How can we make sense of chaos? What is the form for that?\u00a0</p>\n<p>Google-able fact: \u201cUnarmed black people were killed at five times the rate of unarmed whites in 2015\u201d (Mapping Police Violence).\u00a0</p>\n<p>Google-able fact: \u201cThere is no federal database that tracks the number of people of any race killed by police. Some individuals and groups have compiled their own databases, such as The Root and Hiphopandpolitics.com, using information from media and law enforcement reports\u201d (Los Angeles Times).</p>\n<p>Non-Google-able fact: When my son wakes from his dream, he finds me in another room folding clothes. He lies down next to me on the sofa. In his dream we are separated. There is an elsewhere, he says, where children sleep and never wake. I touch his forehead which now feels hot with fever.</p>\n<p>&amp;</p>\n<p>List of the times my son has registered hurt:\u00a0</p>\n<p>- His friend kicks him in the spine. The mother of the boy does not notice.<br />\n- A neighbor asks him if he has a gun in his pocket.<br />\n- He realizes we are not the same person.<br />\n- He walks up to a group of boys in his class. Turns back to me, asks me to say goodbye one more time.\u00a0<br />\n- He mentions under his breath that I never listen to his stories.<br />\n- When I defend him too fiercely. He storms away. Locks the door.<br />\n- A white boy steals his school snacks and he is hungry. When he tells a head teacher, she doesn\u2019t believe him.\u00a0<br />\n- My mother calls his hair crazy. She asks him to cut it each time she sees him.<br />\n- We play basketball and when he can\u2019t get the ball in the basket, he runs away and hides.<br />\n- My friend tells me that all the girls like the blonde, blue-eyed boy in the class. When I\u2019m silent she says, \u201cThey like your boy too, of course.\u201d<br />\n- I asked him to get out of bed. Instead, he stood on his mattress and raised both arms up.<br />\n- Outside his window, he views police officers surround a man. He doesn\u2019t know if he should feel for the officers or the man standing at the center, panting hard.<br />\n- He often tells me he doesn\u2019t understand the meanness of boys. Mentions maybe it\u2019s better to stand somewhere in the middle or somewhere alone.<br />\n- In the basement of my home, his friend straddles him, punches him in the head over a dozen times. He did not sound out or call for help. Later, he said my husband told him never to hit a girl so he laid there waiting for the punches to stop.\u00a0<br />\n- I was far from the house.\u00a0<br />\n- I was not home.</p>\n<p>\u02dc\u00a0</p>\n<p>I sometimes try not to register his pain. When I do, I often find myself immobile.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u02dc\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0<br />\nHybrid forms leave fences open. They are wide fields with snow leopards, wolves, and honey bees. The combustion of imaginings forms a lake, water spreading, explosions on the surface of an oil slick.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Hybrida is the change of properties. Long ago the earth plates shifted, came together in new permutations. New land. New World. It permits a space to be wounded, sutured, broken again, and untied to float to a beyond.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This mixed presence is a ghost, converses with the living. What lingers sounds like leaves crushed beneath feet, or the light that remains on after you\u2019ve distinctly shut it, the house in the field over there, the one that keeps living whether you view it or not. Lights in the upstairs room. Shadows move when the wind changes its mind. It seems inhabited, doesn\u2019t it?</p>\n<p>\u00a0\u02dc</p>\n<p>I am afraid for vocabulary and its presence in the struggle. It lives at the center of a circle and it\u2019s been bred to salivate, primed for impatience, with a hand at its back coaxing it toward its gritty death. We could say this hand is history but this isn\u2019t true. Vocabulary is the future we\u2019ve all been waiting for. It lunges at the throat of man\u2019s deepest intentions. I hear the crush of cartilage, an ankle wobble for recovery, the quick intake of breath. There is a fall but the crowd is so thick now, I cannot see. I rely on my other senses to brace myself for what\u2019s about to happen.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u02dc<br />\nLook out and look backward. The story we are living now is an ancient one. It has been lived before but feels new in this present existence. Open the books. This already happened, in different guises, on the shores of other lands, evolved forms hemorrhaging before it sprouts new wings, before the beak breaks through the surface, a new oration, legs jutting from an interior rush of nomadic longing.

But it\u2019s changing. \u00a0<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n"}, {"title": "Revolutionary Kiss", "view_node": "/poem/revolutionary-kiss", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/tina-chang\" hreflang=\"und\">Tina Chang</a>", "field_date_published": "2019", "body": "<p>I had never created man before so I invented my son first as a dream body. In order to create the dream body I must first believe in the force of opposites, a terrible tension of what has existed and the struggle yet to come. And it is true, that I had a notion of him for many years; for generations my imagination traveled in search of him. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>It seems unlikely that a kiss would have roots in the Haitian Revolution, but it does. Over a century ago, an uprising of hundreds of thousands of slaves freed themselves from chain and rope, from whip and guillotine, from bondage through the struggle of blood. They fought for thirteen years in a revolution to stand on the shores of their own land, newly named Haiti, as free people and they kissed the ground however damp with the blood of their mothers, fathers, brothers, and sons. Slaves, newly liberated whispered my son\u2019s name, his dream body envisioned there, beneath the rust of shackles, beside shards of slaveowners\u2019 homes, rising with smoke from burned plantations. Past the pinnacle of scoured light, past the canopy of trees dripping with the uprising of future leaves, my son begins his journey to me. \u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Once there was a chain of kisses as my mother said goodbye to her brothers and sisters lined in a row, as she left Taiwan for America, a shock of leis around her neck as she waved to a country of ghosts. My mother\u2019s history was equally complex. She left China in 1949, when communists led by Chairman Mao took over mainland China. My mother crowded into a boat that would take her to the coast of Taiwan known as <em>the beautiful island</em>, which she would one day yearn to leave.</p>\n\n<p>By foot, by boat, by train, by bus, by plane. It seems impossible these two histories intertwine so that one day I may find a dream body housed inside mine. All along, I wring my hands and worry, will I know how to mother him? What language will I speak? What will my mother utter once she discovers the detour of my ancestry? Will she abandon me, turn the portraits of my ancestors toward the wall, backs directed away from my longing?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" text=\"\">.</p>\n\n<p>When I woke, the doctor\u2019s voice was muffled and thick. My mind moved in syncopated pulses and I pushed until all energy drained and my body cracked open. Liquid gold rushed away. Finally and now. He arrived, a purpled creature, violet and squirming, face crushed into an emperor\u2019s expression.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Born from the urgency of immigrants, how futile all of my years of worrying. I should have known my boy would row his small boat to me, regardless of the sky above that shook down its lightning, and even if the ground was bruised and famished of fruit and even freedom, he would continue on as if a force were lulling him to bedrock. Right here between his eyebrows, there is swell of light, a country where I belong, no longer a stranger to my own skin. My mouth to his temple, an alarm cries. Tanks roll through the tale squeaking, turning their heavy wheels. When I kiss him, history\u2019s weapons fall from my pockets, shields cast beneath attalea trees. I will now end my days of resistance, my lips searching the entirety of his dream face made mortal, my lost shadows now migrating in unison.\u00a0</p>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 107, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
