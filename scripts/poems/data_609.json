Though our radiator is painted the color of the walls we know he's there. Whatever we set on top of him bursts angrily into flame. He has come to be known as Petulant.

To be contrary, the radiator will not heat us when we need it. \"If only I could find his fucking face,\" I say to her (who sleeps beside me), \"I'd stick something in his eye. I'd stick this in his eye.\" And I hold out a fork. Night has grown up around us and this luminous fork is our only light. 2. By the light of our luminous fork I see the old Mexican shortwave radio weeping on the corner. All her tubes are cracked and it is late in the century. No one will be putting on a hat and boots to find tubes for her, because they can't be found. She is like the last auk in its cage with a shattered wishbone, while the naturalists were helpless and could offer to bring it something, again and again. She is like the last passenger pigeon when it realized it was the last passenger pigeon. We don't notice her anymore. \"God's curse on you for ignoring me,\" she used to moan at night. Now she only weeps or says her prayers, but either way we can't hear her because her tubes are withered and it is late in the century. 3. The luminous fork is also worthy of investigation: Our grandparents cannot remember when the luminous fork first came into their lives. It was prefigured by the tools of Poseidon and Michael. It has appeared in my poems before. It is the last of the luminous flatware and is lonely in our drawer. Imagine a luminous fork in the company of our silverware and their steely glances. Think about this fork who cannot share his secrets with the dark knives, who will never lie with the smooth spoons. The luminous fork knows that someday when I open the drawer I won't recognize him among the tarnished forks pointing at me, just as I am told one day there will come a knock at my door that I won't answer.</p> "}, {"title": "Age Moves", "view_node": "/poem/age-moves", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/liam-rector\" hreflang=\"und\">Liam Rector</a>", "field_date_published": "1994", "body": " <pre>&#13;\nAge moves in the hound&#13;\nAs it was in me moving&#13;\nThrough forest I found&#13;\n&#13;\nAs to dog I went&#13;\nThat year scrounging&#13;\nThrough Manhattan....&#13;\n&#13;\nThe wood opened out,&#13;\nUnlikely in the city,&#13;\nAs to boy slandering&#13;\n&#13;\nTo leave his fitful home,&#13;\nBright he might survive&#13;\nWith his pen-knife only. </pre>&#13;\n "}, {"title": "Hans Reading, Hans Smoking", "view_node": "/poem/hans-reading-hans-smoking", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/liam-rector\" hreflang=\"und\">Liam Rector</a>", "field_date_published": "1994", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">My mother, poised around behavior, would say</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You are sitting there reading and smoking, Hans,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And this would describe for her, to her utter</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Satisfaction, what it is you are doing.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knowing you I guess you are stationed there</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In grief, reverie, worry--your car broken</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Down, the mechanic wanting money, and you without,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the moment, what it takes--and you thinking</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of love lost as you read that impossible book</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Your father last gave you....I see you smoking</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as an addict myself I know this is something</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You are barely doing....The habit smokes itself</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And you, you are turning the page where the woman</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From New Orleans, like your woman, goes to Manhattan.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I suppose my mother, in her mania, could never afford</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">To think there was anything hovering around, anything</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><em>Behind </em>behavior.
