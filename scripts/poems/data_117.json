dire misfortunes that a ship befell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which outward bound, to St. Eustatia's shore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Death and disaster through the billows bore.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0From Philadelphia's crowded port she came;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For there the builder plann'd her lofty frame,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With wond'rous skill, and excellence of art</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He form'd, dispos'd, and order'd every part,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With joy beheld the stately fabric rise</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To a stout bulwark of stupendous size,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Till launch'd at last, capacious of the freight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He left her to the Pilots, and her fate.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0First from her depths the tapering masts ascend,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On whose firm bulk the transverse yards depend,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By shrouds and stays secur'd from side to side</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Trees grew on trees, suspended o'er the tide,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Firm to the yards extended, broad and vast</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They hung the sails susceptive of the blast,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far o'er the prow the lengthy bowsprit lay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Supporting on the extreme the taught Gib-stay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twice ten six pounders at their port holes plac'd</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And rang'd in rows, stood hostile in the waist:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus all prepar'd, impatient for the seas,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She left her station with an adverse breeze,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This her first outset from her native shore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To seas a stranger, and untry'd before.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0From the bright radiance that his glories spread</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ere from the east gay Ph\u0153bus lifts his head,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From the sweet morn, a kindred name she won,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><em>Aurora</em>\u00a0call'd, the offspring of the sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose form projecting, the broad prow displays,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far glittering o'er the wave, a mimic blaze.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The gay ship now, in all her pomp and pride,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With sails expanded, flew along the tide;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Twas thy deep stream, O Delaware, that bore</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This pile intended for a southern shore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bound to those isles where endless summer reigns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fair fruits, gay blossoms, and enamell'd plains;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where sloping lawns the roving swain invite,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the cool morn succeeds the breezy night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where each glad day a heaven unclouded brings</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And sky-topt mountains teem with golden springs.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0From Cape Henlopen, urg'd by favouring gales,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When morn emerg'd, we sea-ward spread our sails,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then east-south-east explor'd the briny way,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close to the wind, departing from the bay;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No longer seen the hoarse resounding strand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With hearts elate we hurried from the land,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Escap'd the dangers of that shelvy ground,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To sailors fatal, and for wrecks renown'd.\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0The gale increases as we stem the main,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now scarce the hills their sky-blue mist retain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At last they sink beneath the rolling wave</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That seems their summits, as they sink, to lave;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Abaft the beam the freshening breezes play,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No mists advancing to deform the day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No tempests rising o'er the splendid scene,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A sea unruffled, and a heaven serene.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Now Sol's bright lamp, the heav'n born source of light,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Had pass'd the line of his meridian height,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And westward hung\u2014retreating from the view</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shores disappear'd, and every hill withdrew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When, still suspicious of some neighbouring foe,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Aloft the Master bade a Seaman go,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To mark if, from the mast's aspiring height</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through all the round a vessel came in sight.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Too soon the Seaman's glance, extending wide,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far distant in the east a ship espy'd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her lofty masts stood bending to the gale,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close to the wind was brac'd each shivering sail;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Next from the deck we saw the approaching foe,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her spangled bottom seem'd in flames to glow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When to the winds she bow'd in dreadful haste</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And her lee-guns lay delug'd in the waste:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From her top-gallant flow'd an English Jack;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With all her might she strove to gain our track,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor strove in vain\u2014with pride and power elate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wing'd on by hell, she drove us to our fate;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No stop no stay her bloody crew intends,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(So flies a comet with its host of fiends)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor oaths, nor prayers arrest her swift career,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Death in her front, and ruin in her rear.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Struck at the sight, the Master gave command</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To change our course, and steer toward the land\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swift to the task the ready sailors run,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And while the word was utter'd, half was done:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As from the south the fiercer breezes rise</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swift from her foe alarm'd Aurora flies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With every sail extended to the wind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She fled the unequal foe that chac'd behind;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Along her decks dispos'd in close array</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each at its port, the grim artillery lay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon on the foe with brazen throat to roar;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But, small their size, and narrow was their bore;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet faithful they their destin'd station keep</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To guard the barque that wafts them o'er the deep,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who now must bend to steer a homeward course</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And trust her swiftness rather than her force,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unfit to combat with a powerful foe;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her decks too open, and her waist too low.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0While o'er the wave with foaming prow she flies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Once more emerging, distant landscapes rise;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">High in the air the starry streamer plays,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And every sail its various tribute pays:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To gain the land we bore the weighty blast;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And now the wish'd for cape appear'd at last;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the vext foe, impatient of delay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Prepar'd for ruin, press'd upon her prey;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Near, and more near, in aweful grandeur came</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The frigate\u00a0<em>Iris</em>, not unknown to fame;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><em>Iris</em>\u00a0her name, but\u00a0<em>Hancock</em>\u00a0once she bore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fram'd and completed on New Albion's shore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By Manly lost, the swiftest of the train</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That fly with wings of canvas o'er the main.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Now, while for combat some with zeal prepare,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus to the heavens the Boatswain sent his prayer:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"List, all ye powers that rule the skies and seas!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Shower down perdition on such thieves as these,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Fate, strike their hearts with terror and dismay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"And sprinkle on their powder salt-sea spray!</span><br /><span

round-top's giddy height</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Be canted headlong to perpetual night;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"May fiends torment them on a leeward coast,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"And help forsake them when they want it most\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"From their wheel'd engines torn be every gun\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"And now, to sum up every curse in one,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"May latent flames, to save us, intervene,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"And hell-ward drive them from their magazine!\"\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Frigate now had every sail unfurl'd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And rush'd tremendous o'er the wat'ry world;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus fierce Pelides, eager to destroy,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Chac'd the proud Trojan to the gates of Troy\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swift o'er the waves while hostile they pursue</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As swiftly from their fangs\u00a0<em>Aurora</em>\u00a0flew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At length Henlopen's cape we gain'd once more,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And vainly strove to force the ship ashore;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stern fate forbade the barren shore to gain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Denial sad, and source of future pain!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For then the inspiring breezes ceas'd to blow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lost were they all, and smooth the seas below;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By the broad cape becalm'd, our lifeless sails</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No longer swell'd their bosoms to the gales;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The ship, unable to pursue her way,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tumbling about, at her own guidance lay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No more the helm its wonted influence lends,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No oars assist us, and no breeze befriends;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Meantime the foe, advancing from the sea,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rang'd her black cannon, pointed on our lee,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then up she luff'd, and blaz'd her entrails dire,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bearing destruction, terror, death and fire.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Vext at our fate, we prim'd a piece, and then</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Return'd the shot, to shew them we were men.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dull night at length her dusky pinions spread,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And every hope to 'scape the foe was fled;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close to thy cape, Henlopen, though we press'd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We could not gain thy desert, dreary breast;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though ruin'd trees beshroud thy barren shore</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With mounds of sand half hid, or cover'd o'er,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though ruffian winds disturb thy summit bare,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet every hope and every wish was there;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In vain we sought to reach the joyless strand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fate stood between, and barr'd us from the land.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0All dead becalm'd, and helpless as we lay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The ebbing current forc'd us back to sea,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While vengeful\u00a0<em>Iris</em>, thirsting for our blood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flash'd her red lightnings o'er the trembling flood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At every flash a storm of ruin came</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Till our shock'd vessel shook through all her frame\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mad for revenge, our breasts with fury glow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To wreak returns of vengeance on the foe;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Full at his hull our pointed guns we rais'd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His hull resounded as the cannon blaz'd;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through his main top-sail one a passage tore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His sides re-echo'd to the dreadful roar,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Alternate fires dispell'd the shades of night\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But how unequal was this daring fight!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Our stoutest guns threw but a six-pound ball,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twelve pounders from the foe our sides did maul,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, while no power to save him intervenes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A bullet struck our captain of Marines;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fierce, though he bid defiance to the foe</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He felt his death and ruin in the blow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Headlong he fell, distracted with the wound,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The deck distain'd, and heart blood streaming round.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Another blast, as fatal in its aim,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wing'd by destruction, through our rigging came,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, whistling tunes from hell upon its way,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shrouds, stays, and braces tore at once away,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sails, blocks, and oars in scatter'd fragments fly\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their softest language was\u2014<em>submit, or die!</em></span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Repeated cries throughout the ship resound;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now every bullet brought a different wound;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Twixt wind and water, one assail'd the side,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through this aperture rush'd the briny tide\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Twas then the Master trembled for his crew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And bade thy shores, O Delaware, adieu!\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And must we yield to yon' destructive ball,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And must our colours to these ruffians fall!\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They fall!\u2014his thunders forc'd our

green,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And leafy trees on mountain tops are seen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But they no groves nor grassy mountains tread,</span><br /><span

endless woes abound,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So many mischiefs in these hulks are found,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That on them all a poem to prolong</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would swell too high the horrors of my song\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hunger and thirst to work our woe combine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And mouldy

whose virtue warms the world beside,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was by these tyrants to our use denied,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While yet they deign'd that healthy juice to lade</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The putrid water felt its powerful aid;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when refus'd\u2014to aggravate our pains\u2014</span><br /><span

head,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No physic here, no doctor to assist,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My name was enter'd on the sick man's list;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twelve wretches more the same dark symptoms took,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And these were enter'd on the doctor's book;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The

soldiers sent to guard us on our road,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Joyful we left the\u00a0<em>Scorpion's</em>\u00a0dire abode;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some tears we shed for

/><span class=\"long-line\">That wretch who, banish'd from the navy crew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grown old in blood, did here his trade renew;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His serpent's tongue, when on his charge let loose,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Utter'd reproaches, scandal, and abuse,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gave all to hell who dar'd his king

often that we were not sick\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And yet so pale!\u2014that we were thought by some</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A freight of ghosts from Death's

class=\"long-line\">There toss'd and tumbled in the dismal shade,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There no soft voice their bitter fate bemoan'd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Death strode stately, while the victims groan'd;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of leaky decks I heard them long complain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Drown'd as they were in deluges of rain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Deny'd the comforts of a dying bed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And not a pillow to support the head\u2014</span><br /><span

May,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What fiery force the earth renews,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The wealth of forms, the flush of hues;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What

spike of tender green</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bartered its powdery cap;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the colors of joy in the bird,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the love in its carol heard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Frog and lizard in holiday coats,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And turtle brave in his golden spots;</span><br /><span

class=\"long-line\">Faster flowing o'er the plains,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A world-wide wave with a foaming edge</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That rims the running silver

class=\"long-line\">In columbine and clover-blow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Climbing the northern zones,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where a thousand pallid towns</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lie like cockles by the main,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or tented armies on a plain.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The million-handed sculptor moulds</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Quaintest bud and blossom folds,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The million-handed painter pours</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Opal hues and

where it comes this courier fleet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fans in all hearts expectance sweet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if to-morrow should redeem</span><br /><span

mien,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if Time brought a new relay</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of shining virgins every May,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Summer came to ripen maids</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To a beauty that not fades.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0I saw the bud-crowned Spring go forth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stepping daily onward north</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To greet staid ancient cavaliers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filing single in stately train.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And who, and who are the travellers?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They were Night and Day, and Day and Night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pilgrims wight with step forthright.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I saw the Days deformed and low,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Short and bent by cold and snow;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The merry Spring threw wreaths on them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flower-wreaths gay with bud and bell;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Many a flower and many a gem,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They were refreshed by the smell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They shook the snow from hats and shoon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They put their April raiment on;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And those eternal forms,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unhurt by a thousand storms,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shot up to the height of the sky again,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And danced as merrily as young men.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I saw them mask their awful glance</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sidewise meek in gossamer lids;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And to speak my thought if none forbids</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was as if the eternal gods,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tired of their starry periods,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hid their majesty in cloth</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Woven of tulips and painted moth.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On carpets green the maskers march</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Below May's well-appointed arch,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each star, each god; each grace amain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Every joy and virtue speed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Marching duly in her train,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And fainting Nature at her need</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is made whole again.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0'Twas the vintage-day of field and wood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When magic wine for bards is brewed;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Every tree and stem and chink</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gushed with syrup to the brink.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The air stole into the streets of towns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Refreshed the wise, reformed the clowns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And betrayed the fund of joy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the high-school and medalled boy:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On from hall to chamber ran,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From youth to maid, from boy to man,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To babes, and to old eyes as well.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Once more,' the old man cried, 'ye clouds,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Airy turrets purple-piled,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which once my infancy beguiled,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beguile me with the wonted spell.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I know ye skilful to convoy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The total freight of hope and joy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into rude and homely nooks,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shed mocking lustres on shelf of books,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On farmer's byre, on pasture

class=\"long-line\">By new delights, as old by old,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Frankly I will be your guest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Count your change and cheer the best.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The world hath overmuch of pain,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If Nature give me joy again,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of such

/><span class=\"long-line\">Yon broidered zodiac girds.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I know the trusty almanac</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the punctual coming-back,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On their due days, of the birds.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I marked them yestermorn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A flock of finches darting</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beneath the crystal arch,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Piping, as they flew, a march,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Belike the one they used in parting</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Last year from yon oak or larch;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dusky sparrows in a crowd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Diving, darting northward free,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly betook them all,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Every one to his hole in the wall,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or to his niche in the apple-tree.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I greet with joy the choral trains</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fresh from palms and Cuba's canes.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Best gems of Nature's cabinet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With dews of tropic morning wet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beloved of children, bards and Spring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">O birds, your perfect virtues bring,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Your song, your forms, your rhythmic flight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Your manners for the heart's delight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nestle in hedge, or barn, or roof,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here weave your chamber weather-proof,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Forgive our harms, and condescend</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To man, as to a lubber friend,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And,

/><span class=\"long-line\">Hid in milk we drew</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At the barrier of Time,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When our life was new.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We had eaten fairy fruit,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We were quick from head to foot,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the forms we looked on shone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As with diamond dews thereon.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What cared we for costly joys,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Museum's far-fetched toys?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gleam of sunshine on the wall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Poured a deeper cheer than all</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The revels of the Carnival.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We a pine-grove did prefer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To a marble theatre,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Could with gods on mallows dine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor cared for spices or for wine.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wreaths of mist and rainbow spanned.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Arch on arch, the grimmest land;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whittle of a woodland bird</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Made the pulses dance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Note of horn in valleys heard</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled the region with romance.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0None can tell how sweet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How virtuous, the morning air;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Every accent vibrates well;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not alone the wood-bird's call,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or shouting boys that chase their ball,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pass the height of minstrel skill,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the ploughman's thoughtless cry,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lowing oxen, sheep that bleat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the joiner's hammer-beat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Softened are above their will,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Take tones from groves they wandered through</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or flutes which passing angels blew.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All grating discords melt,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No dissonant note is dealt,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And though thy voice be shrill</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like rasping file on steel,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such is the temper of the air,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Echo waits with art and care,</span><br

Mackinac,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When northern storms the forest shake,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And billows on the long beach break,</span><br /><span

breast</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All but godlike words,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Reporting to the happy ear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only purified accords.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strangely wrought from barking waves,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soft music daunts the Indian braves,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Convent-chanting which the child</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hears pealing from the panther's cave</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the impenetrable wild.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0Soft on the South-wind sleeps the haze:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So on thy broad mystic van</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lie the opal-colored days,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And waft the miracle to man.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soothsayer of the eldest gods,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Repairer of what harms betide,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Revealer of the inmost powers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Prometheus proffered, Jove denied;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Disclosing treasures more than true,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or in what far to-morrow due;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speaking by the tongues of flowers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By the ten-tongued laurel speaking,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Singing by the oriole songs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Heart of bird the man's heart seeking;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whispering hints of treasure hid</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Under Morn's unlifted lid,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Islands looming just beyond</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The dim horizon's utmost bound;\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who can, like thee, our rags upbraid,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or taunt us with our hope decayed?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or who like thee persuade,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Making the splendor of the air,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The morn and sparkling dew, a snare?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or who resent</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thy genius, wiles and blandishment?</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0There is no orator prevails</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To beckon or persuade</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like thee the youth or maid:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thy birds, thy songs, thy brooks, thy gales,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thy blooms, thy kinds,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thy echoes in the wilderness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soothe pain, and age, and love's distress,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fire fainting will, and build heroic minds.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0For thou, O Spring! canst renovate</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All that high God did first create.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Be still his arm and architect,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rebuild the ruin, mend defect;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Chemist to vamp old worlds with new,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Coat sea and sky with heavenlier blue,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">New tint the plumage of the birds,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And slough decay from grazing herds,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sweep ruins from the scarped mountain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cleanse the torrent at the fountain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Purge alpine air by towns defiled,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bring to fair mother fairer child,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not less renew the heart and brain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Scatter the sloth, wash out the stain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Make the aged eye sun-clear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To parting soul bring grandeur near.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Under gentle types, my Spring</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Masks the might of Nature's king,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">An energy that searches thorough</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From Chaos to the dawning morrow;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into all our human plight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The soul's pilgrimage and flight;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In city or in solitude,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Step by step, lifts bad to good,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Without halting, without rest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lifting Better up to Best;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Planting seeds of knowledge pure,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through earth to ripen, through heaven endure.</span></p>\n"},
