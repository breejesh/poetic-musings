No &#13;\n   fault was found with our contract, of which &#13;\neach article had been so correctly framed &#13;\n   (if I may say so) &#13;\n   as to ascertain &#13;\na pre-nuptial alliance which must persuade &#13;\n   <i>and</i> please the most punctilious (and &#13;\n         impecunious) &#13;\n         of future husbands. &#13;\n   Principally, or (if I may be &#13;\nallowed the amendment) perhaps Ducally, &#13;\n   His Grace acknowledged &#13;\n   himself <i>beguiled</i> by &#13;\nCranach's portrait of our young Countess, praising &#13;\n   the design, the hues, the glaze--the frame &#13;\n         and appeared averse, &#13;\n         for a while, even &#13;\n   to letting the panel leave his hands! &#13;\nExamining those same hands, I was convinced &#13;\n   that no matter what &#13;\n   the result of our &#13;\n(at this point, promising) negotiations, &#13;\n   your daughter's likeness must now remain &#13;\n         \"for good,\" as we say, &#13;\n         among Ferrara's &#13;\n   treasures, already one more trophy &#13;\nin His Grace's multifarious <i>holdings</i>, &#13;\n   like those marble busts &#13;\n   lining the drawbridge, &#13;\nlike those weed-stained statues grinning up at us &#13;\n   from the still moat, and--inside as well &#13;\n         as out--those grotesque &#13;\n         figures and faces &#13;\n   fastened to the walls.

And took, &#13;\n   so evident was &#13;\n   the supremacy, &#13;\nno further pains to assert Fra Pandolf's skill. &#13;\n   One last hard look, whereupon the Duke &#13;\n         resumed his discourse &#13;\n         in an altered tone, &#13;\n   now some unintelligible rant &#13;\nof <i>stooping</i>--His Grace chooses \"never to stoop\" &#13;\n   when he makes reproof... &#13;\n   My Lord will take this &#13;\nas but a figure:  not only is the Duke &#13;\n      no longer young, his body is so &#13;\n         queerly misshapen &#13;\n         that even to <i>speak</i> &#13;\n   of \"not stooping\" seems absurdity: &#13;\nthe creature <i>is</i> stooped, whether by cruel &#13;\n   or impartial cause--say &#13;\n   Time or the Tempter-- &#13;\nI shall not venture to hypothecate. Cause &#13;\n   or no cause, it would appear he marked &#13;\n         some motive for his &#13;\n         \"reproof,\" a mortal &#13;\n   chastisement in fact inflicted on &#13;\nhis poor Duchess, <i>put away</i> (I take it so) &#13;\n   for smiling--at whom?  &#13;\n   Brother Pandolf? or &#13;\nsome visitor to court during the sitting? &#13;\n   --too generally, if I construe &#13;\n         the Duke's clue rightly, &#13;\n         to survive the terms &#13;\n   of his... severe protocol.  My Lord, &#13;\nat the time it was delivered to me thus, &#13;\n   the admonition &#13;\n   if indeed it was &#13;\nany such thing, seemed no more of a menace &#13;\n   than the rest of his rodomontade; &#13;\n         <i>item</i>, he pointed, &#13;\n         as we toiled downstairs, &#13;\n   to that bronze <i>Neptune</i> by our old Claus &#13;\n(there must be at least six of them cluttering &#13;\n   the Summer Palace &#13;\n   at Innsbruck), claiming &#13;\nit was \"cast in bronze for me.\"  Nonsense, of course.  &#13;\n&#13;\n   But upon reflection, I suppose &#13;\n            we had better take &#13;\n            the old reprobate &#13;\n   at his unspeakable word... Why, even &#13;\nassuming his boasts should be as plausible &#13;\n   as his avarice, &#13;\n   no \"cause\" for dismay: &#13;\nonce ensconced here as the Duchess, your daughter &#13;\n   need no more apprehend the Duke's &#13;\n            murderous temper &#13;\n            than his matchless taste.  &#13;\n   For I have devised a means whereby &#13;\nthe dowry so flagrantly pursued by our &#13;\n   insolvent Duke (\"no &#13;\n   just pretense of mine &#13;\nbe disallowed\" indeed!), instead of being &#13;\n   paid as he pleads in one globose sum, &#13;\n            should drip into his &#13;\n            coffers by degrees--&#13;\n   say, one fifth each year--then after five &#13;\nsuch years, the dowry itself to be doubled, &#13;\n   always assuming &#13;\n   that Her Grace enjoys &#13;\nher usual smiling health.  The years are her &#13;\n   ally in such an arbitrament, &#13;\n            and with confidence &#13;\n            My Lord can assure &#13;\n   the new Duchess (assuming her Duke &#13;\nabides by these stipulations and his own &#13;\n   propensity for &#13;\n   accumulating &#13;\n\"semblances\") the long devotion (so long as &#13;\n   <i>he</i> lasts ) of her last Duke... Or more likely, &#13;\n            if I guess aright &#13;\n            your daughter's intent, &#13;\n   of that young lordling I might make so &#13;\nbold as to designate her next Duke, as well... &#13;\n&#13;\n               Ever determined in &#13;\n   My Lordship's service, &#13;\n   I remain his Envoy &#13;\nto Ferrara as to the world.  &#13;\n                              Nikolaus Mardruz.</pre>&#13;\n "}, {"title": "Late Night Ode", "view_node": "/poem/late-night-ode", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/j-d-mcclatchy\" hreflang=\"und\">J.
