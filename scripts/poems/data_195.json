class=\"long-line\">Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If I lose thee, my loss is my love\u2019s gain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Both find each other, and I lose both twain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And both for my sake lay on me this cross:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But here\u2019s the joy; my friend and I are one;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits (Sonnet 41)", "view_node": "/poem/those-pretty-wrongs-liberty-commits-sonnet-41", "field_author": "<a
