The calm shade<br />Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze<br />That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm<br />To thy sick heart. Thou wilt find nothing here<br />Of all that pained thee in the haunts of men<br />And made thee loathe thy life. The primal curse<br />Fell, it is true, upon the unsinning earth,<br />But not in vengeance. God hath yoked to guilt<br />Her pale tormentor, misery. Hence, these shades<br />Are still the abodes of gladness; the thick roof<br />Of green and stirring branches is alive<br />And musical with birds, that sing and sport<br />In wantonness of spirit; while below<br />The squirrel, with raised paws and form erect,<br />Chirps merrily. Throngs of insects in the shade<br />Try their thin wings and dance in the warm beam<br />That waked them into life. Even the green trees<br />Partake the deep contentment; as they bend<br />To the soft winds, the sun from the blue sky<br />Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene.<br />Scarce less the cleft-born wild-flower seems to enjoy<br />Existence, than the winged plunderer<br />That sucks its sweets. The massy rocks themselves,<br />And the old and ponderous trunks of prostrate trees<br />That lead from knoll to knoll a causey rude<br />Or bridge the sunken brook, and their dark roots,<br />With all their earth upon them, twisting high,<br />Breathe fixed tranquillity. The rivulet<br />Sends forth glad sounds, and tripping o'er its bed<br />Of pebbly sands, or leaping down the rocks,<br />Seems, with continuous laughter, to rejoice<br />In its own being. Softly tread the marge,<br />Lest from her midway perch thou scare the wren<br />That dips her bill in water. The cool wind,<br />That stirs the stream in play, shall come to thee,<br />Like one that loves thee nor will let thee pass<br />Ungreeted, and shall give its light embrace.</p> "}, {"title": "our happiness ", "view_node": "/poem/our-happiness", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/eileen-myles\" hreflang=\"und\">Eileen Myles</a>", "field_date_published": "2014", "body": " <p>was when the<br />lights were<br />out</p><p>the whole city<br />in darkness</p><p>&amp; we drove north<br />to our friend\u2019s<br />yellow apt.<br />where she had<br />power &amp; we<br />could work</p><p>later we stayed<br />in the darkened<br />apt. you sick<br />in bed &amp; me<br />writing ambitiously<br />by candle light<br />in thin blue<br />books</p><p>your neighbor had<br />a generator &amp;<br />after a while<br />we had a little<br />bit of light</p><p>I walked the<br />dog &amp; you<br />were still<br />a little bit<br />sick</p><p>we sat on a stoop<br />one day in the<br />late afternoon<br />we had very little<br />money. enough for<br />a strong cappuccino<br />which we shared<br />sitting there &amp;<br />suddenly the<br />city was lit.</p> "}, {"title": "My Mother Sent Me ", "view_node": "/poem/my-mother-sent-me", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/michael-meyerhofer\" hreflang=\"en\">Michael  Meyerhofer</a>", "field_date_published": "2014", "body": " <p>a text message<br />from her coffin.<br />It said <em>Glad<br />you\u2019re not here.</em><br />She's always doing<br />stuff like that.

Roland the cousin bought\nA box of face powder for his younger cousin,\nAnd on the octopus, which they had ridden\nSo often the owner let them ride for free,\nHe convinced her to open up the box.\nRoland\u2019s horn resounds through ages\nOf high school lit classes.  There\u2019s a cloud\nThe carnie thinks is an explosion and stops\nHis ride, and banishes the powdered laughing children,\nRoland, the young hero, and my mother\nCreamy with dust in a new blue coat.\nRoland's song comes down from the Pyrenees.\nHis namesake went back to school, after his wife left,\nBecame a mining engineer, worked in North Dakota,\nMarried again, learned after the death of his parents\nHe\u2019d been adopted, was devastated, and died\nIn his late 30s of congenital heart failure.  He lives on, though.\nAn old woman remembers that day at the fair\nAnd as much of his life and fate as any of us\nIs likely to have immortalized in song.\n\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Willow Poem", "view_node": "/poem/willow-poem", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-carlos-williams\" hreflang=\"und\">William Carlos Williams</a>", "field_date_published": "2014", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">It is a willow when summer is over,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a willow by the river</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from which no leaf has fallen nor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">bitten by the sun</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">turned orange or crimson.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The leaves cling and grow paler,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">swing and grow paler</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">over the swirling waters of the river</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as if loath to let go,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they are so cool, so drunk with</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the swirl of the wind and of the river\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">oblivious to winter,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the last to let go and fall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into the water and on the ground.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Toy Cloud", "view_node": "/poem/toy-cloud", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/nathan-hoks\" hreflang=\"en\">Nathan  Hoks</a>", "field_date_published": "2014", "body": " <p>The rabbit has stolen<br />The big bear\u2019s pointy red hat.</p><p>The frog looks longingly<br />At its evaporating pond.</p><p>A powerful glow comes<br />Off the sunflower</p><p>So everyone wears goggles.<br />My son rolls around in the ferns.</p><p>It seems he has overdosed<br />On sugar cookies.</p><p>Does he care about the bear\u2019s hat?<br />To him I am a ghost on a bicycle.</p><p>I remember my father\u2019s mouth<br />Reading aloud beneath his beard.</p><p>He is hiding in my face.<br />The toy cloud is filled with rain.<br />\u00a0</p> "}, {"title": "Sundial", "view_node": "/poem/sundial", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/larry-sawyer\" hreflang=\"en\">Larry  Sawyer</a>", "field_date_published": "2014", "body": " <p><em>for James Wright</em></p><p><br />\u00a0\u00a0 The poet will seek to clothe herself in sparrows.</p><p>A motor in each leaf<br />distills autumn\u2019s engines and we\u2019re off.</p><p>Upstart cartoon morning;<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 these various roosters scratch inside the eyelids<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and declare beneath the streetlamps that their<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 moats are filled with vowels.</p><p>That the life alone is not wasted but<br />rich with a pageantry of else.<br />Who absconds with our best sense<br />and seizes us by the throat as we untangle ourselves<br />from lovers and, draped in fever, split the<br />night into halves?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Each contains a commercial<br />advertising just that.</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Despite his tactics, fully rejecting experience<br />the candid creator winces at the audience\u2019s heightened<br />passing.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Remain, in secret,</p><p>a pea of concern, in some harbor of ghostly direction.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There lurks an I among those hours.</p> "}], "pager": {"current_page": 387, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
