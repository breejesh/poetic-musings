\nAnd there are ears to which the voice of pleasure \n    Still vainly calls ! \nThere's not a scene on earth so full of lightness \n    That withering care \nSleeps not beneath the flowers, and turns their brightness \n    To dark despair! \nOh! Earth, dim Earth, thou canst not be our home; \nOr wherefore look we still for joys to come? \nThe fairy steps are flown\u2014the scene is still\u2014 \nNought mingles with the murmuring of the rill. \nNay, hush! it is a sound\u2014a sigh\u2014again! \nIt is a human voice\u2014the voice of pain. \nAnd beautiful is she, who sighs alone \nNow that her young and playful mates are gone: \nThe dim moon, shining on her statue face, \nGives it a mournful and unearthly grace; \nAnd she hath bent her gentle knee to earth; \n    And she hath raised her meek sad eyes to heaven\u2014 \nAs if in such a breast sin could have birth, \n    She clasps her hands, and sues to be forgiven. \nHer prayer is over; but her anxious glance \n    Into the blue transparency of night \nSeems as it fain would read the book of chance, \n    And fix the future hours, dark or bright. \nA slow and heavy footstep strikes her ear\u2014 \nWhat ails the gentle maiden?\u2014Is it fear? \nLo! she hath lightly raised her from the ground, \nAnd turn'd her small and stag-like head around; \nHer pale cheek paler, and her lips apart, \nHer bosom heaving o'er her beating heart: \nAnd see, those thin white hands she raises now \nTo press the throbbing fever from her brow\u2014 \nIn vain\u2014in vain! for never more shall rest \nFind place in that young, fair, but erring breast! \nHe stands before her now\u2014and who is he \nInto whose outspread arms confidingly \nShe flings her fairy self?\u2014Unlike the forms \nThat woo and win a woman's love\u2014the storms \nOf deep contending passions are not seen \nDarkening

all his Linda's winning wiles. \nYet can we read, what all the rest denies, \n    That he hath feelings of a mortal birth, \nIn the wild sorrow of those dark bright eyes, \n    Bent on that

Which couples guilt and horror with that name? \nWhat boots it that the few who know him shun \nTo speak or eat with that unworthy one? \nWere all their words of scorn and malice proved, \nIt matters not\u2014he loves and he is loved!</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Poet as Immortal Bird", "view_node": "/poem/poet-immortal-bird", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/ron-padgett\" hreflang=\"und\">Ron

to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son.</i>\n\n\n\"Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls\n(So long a stranger) to these honour'd walls?\n'Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay,\nAnd Vulcan's joy and duty to obey.\"\n\nTo whom the mournful mother thus replies:\n(The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:)\n\"O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine\nSo pierced with sorrows, so o'erwhelm'd as mine?\nOf all the goddesses, did Jove prepare\nFor Thetis only such a weight of care?\nI, only I, of all the watery race\nBy force subjected to a man's embrace,\nWho, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays\nThe mighty fine imposed on length of days.\nSprung from my bed, a godlike hero came,\nThe bravest sure that ever bore the name;\nLike some fair plant beneath my careful hand\nHe grew, he flourish'd, and he graced the land:\nTo Troy I sent him! but his native shore\nNever, ah never, shall receive him more;\n(Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;)\nNor I, a goddess, can retard the blow!\nRobb'd of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave,\nThe king of nations forced his royal slave:\nFor this he grieved; and, till the Greeks oppress'd\nRequired his arm, he sorrow'd unredress'd.\nLarge gifts they promise, and their elders send;\nIn vain--he arms not, but permits his friend\nHis arms, his steeds, his forces to employ:\nHe marches, combats, almost conquers Troy:\nThen slain by Phoebus (Hector had the name)\nAt once resigns his armour, life, and fame.\nBut thou, in pity, by my prayer be won:\nGrace with immortal arms this short-lived son,\nAnd to the field in martial pomp restore,\nTo shine with glory, till he shines no more!\"\n\nTo her the artist-god: \"Thy griefs resign,\nSecure, what Vulcan can, is ever thine.\nO could I hide him from the Fates, as well,\nOr with these hands the cruel stroke repel,\nAs I shall forge most envied arms, the gaze\nOf wondering ages, and the world's amaze!\"\n\nThus having said, the father of the fires\nTo the black labours of his forge retires.\nSoon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn'd\nTheir iron mouths; and where the furnace burn'd,\nResounding breathed: at once the blast expires,\nAnd twenty forges catch at once the fires;\nJust as the god directs, now loud, now low,\nThey raise a tempest, or they gently blow;\nIn hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd,\nAnd stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold;\nBefore, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand;\nThe ponderous hammer loads his better hand,\nHis left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round,\nAnd thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.\n\nThen first he form'd the immense and solid shield;\nRich various artifice emblazed the field;\nIts utmost verge a threefold circle bound;\nA silver chain suspends the massy round;\nFive ample plates the broad expanse compose,\nAnd godlike labours on the surface rose.\nThere shone the image of the master-mind:\nThere earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd;\nThe unwearied sun, the moon completely round;\nThe starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd;\nThe Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team;\nAnd great Orion's more refulgent beam;\nTo which, around the axle of the sky,\nThe Bear, revolving, points his golden eye,\nStill shines exalted on the ethereal plain,\nNor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.\n\nTwo cities radiant on the shield appear,\nThe image one of peace, and one of war.\nHere sacred pomp and genial feast delight,\nAnd solemn dance, and hymeneal rite;\nAlong the street the new-made brides are led,\nWith torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:\nThe youthful dancers in a circle bound\nTo the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound:\nThrough the fair streets the matrons in a row\nStand in their porches, and enjoy the show.\n\nThere in the forum swarm a numerous train;\nThe subject of debate, a townsman slain:\nOne pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,\nAnd bade the public and the laws decide:\nThe witness is produced on either hand:\nFor this, or that, the partial people stand:\nThe appointed heralds still the noisy bands,\nAnd form a ring, with sceptres in their hands:\nOn seats of stone, within the sacred place,\nThe reverend elders nodded o'er the case;\nAlternate, each the attesting sceptre took,\nAnd rising solemn, each his sentence spoke\nTwo golden talents lay amidst, in sight,\nThe prize of him who best adjudged the right.\n\nAnother part (a prospect differing far)(255)\nGlow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war.\nTwo mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace,\nAnd one would pillage, one would burn the place.\nMeantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care,\nA secret ambush on the foe prepare:\nTheir wives, their children, and the watchful band\nOf trembling parents, on the turrets stand.\nThey march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold:\nGold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,\nAnd gold their armour: these the squadron led,\nAugust, divine, superior by the head!\nA place for ambush fit they found, and stood,\nCover'd with shields, beside a silver flood.\nTwo spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem\nIf sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.\nSoon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains,\nAnd steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;\nBehind them piping on their reeds they go,\nNor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.\nIn arms the glittering squadron rising round\nRush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;\nWhole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,\nAnd, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!\nThe bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;\nThey rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,\nThey fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;\nThe waving silver seem'd to blush with blood.\nThere Tumult, there Contention stood confess'd;\nOne rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast;\nOne held a living foe, that freshly bled\nWith new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead;\nNow here, now there, the carcases they tore:\nFate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.\nAnd the whole war came out, and met the eye;\nAnd each bold figure seem'd to live or die.\n\nA field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,\nThe third time labour'd by the sweating hind;\nThe shining shares full many ploughmen guide,\nAnd turn their crooked yokes on every side.\nStill as at either end they wheel around,\nThe master meets them with his goblet crown'd;\nThe hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,\nThen back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:\nBehind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;\nAnd sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.\n\nAnother field rose high with waving grain;\nWith bended sickles stand the reaper train:\nHere stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,\nSheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.\nWith sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;\nThe gatherers follow, and collect in bands;\nAnd last the children, in whose arms are borne\n(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.\nThe rustic monarch of the field descries,\nWith silent glee, the heaps around him rise.\nA ready banquet on the turf is laid,\nBeneath an ample oak's expanded shade.\nThe victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;\nThe reaper's due repast, the woman's care.\n\nNext, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,\nBent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;\nA deeper dye the dangling clusters show,\nAnd curl'd on silver props, in order glow:\nA darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;\nAnd pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.\nTo this, one pathway gently winding leads,\nWhere march a train with baskets on their heads,\n(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear\nThe purple product of the autumnal year.\nTo these a youth awakes the warbling strings,\nWhose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;\nIn measured dance behind him move the train,\nTune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.\n\nHere herds of oxen march, erect and bold,\nRear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,\nAnd speed to meadows on whose sounding shores\nA rapid torrent through the rushes roars:\nFour golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,\nAnd nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.\nTwo lions rushing from the wood appear'd;\nAnd seized a bull, the master of the herd:\nHe roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;\nThey tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.\nThe dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,\nDread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.\n\nNext this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads\nDeep through fair forests, and a length of meads,\nAnd stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;\nAnd fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.\n\nA figured dance succeeds; such once was seen\nIn lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,\nForm'd by Daedalean art; a comely band\nOf youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.\nThe maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;\nThe youths all graceful in the glossy vest:\nOf those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;\nOf these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,\nThat glittering gay, from silver belts depend.\nNow all at once they rise, at once descend,\nWith well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,\nConfusedly regular, the moving maze:\nNow forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,\nAnd undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:\nSo whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,\nAnd, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.\nThe gazing multitudes admire around:\nTwo active tumblers in the centre bound;\nNow high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:\nAnd general songs the sprightly revel end.\n\nThus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd\nWith his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:\nIn living silver seem'd the waves to roll,\nAnd beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.\n\nThis done, whate'er a warrior's use requires\nHe forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,\nThe greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd\nWith various sculpture, and the golden crest.\nAt Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:\nShe, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,\nSwift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,\nAnd bears the blazing present through the skies.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Purgatorio, Canto X", "view_node": "/poem/purgatorio-canto-x", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/dante-alighieri\" hreflang=\"und\">Dante Alighieri</a>",

straight,\n\nRe-echoing I heard it closed again;\n  And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,\n  What for my failing had been fit excuse?\n\nWe mounted upward through a rifted rock,\n  Which undulated to this side and that,\n  Even as a wave receding and advancing.\n\n\"Here it behoves us use a little art,\"\n  Began my Leader, \"to adapt ourselves\n  Now here, now there, to the receding side.\"\n\nAnd this our footsteps so infrequent made,\n  That sooner had the moon's decreasing disk\n  Regained its bed to sink again to rest,\n\nThan we were forth from out that needle's eye;\n  But when we free and in the open were,\n  There where the mountain backward piles itself,\n\nI wearied out, and both of us uncertain\n  About our way, we stopped upon a plain\n  More desolate than roads across the deserts.\n\nFrom where its margin borders on the void,\n  To foot of the high bank that ever rises,\n  A human body three times told would measure;\n\nAnd far as eye of mine could wing its flight,\n  Now on the left, and on the right flank now,\n  The same this cornice did appear to me.\n\nThereon our feet had not been moved as yet,\n  When I perceived the embankment round about,\n  Which all right of ascent had interdicted,\n\nTo be of marble white, and so adorned\n  With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,\n  But Nature's self, had there been put to shame.\n\nThe Angel, who came down to earth with tidings\n  Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,\n  And opened Heaven from its long interdict,\n\nIn front of us appeared so truthfully\n  There sculptured in a gracious attitude,\n  He did not seem an image that is silent.\n\nOne would have sworn that he was saying, \"Ave;\"\n  For she was there in effigy portrayed\n  Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,\n\nAnd in her mien this language had impressed,\n  \"Ecce ancilla Dei,\" as distinctly\n  As any figure stamps itself in wax.\n\n\"Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,\"\n  The gentle Master said, who had me standing\n  Upon that side where people have their hearts;\n\nWhereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld\n  In rear of Mary, and upon that side\n  Where he was standing who conducted me,\n\nAnother story on the rock imposed;\n  Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,\n  So that before mine eyes it might be set.\n\nThere sculptured in the self-same marble were\n  The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,\n  Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.\n\nPeople appeared in front, and all of them\n  In seven choirs divided, of two senses\n  Made one say \"No,\" the other, \"Yes, they sing.\"\n\nLikewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,\n  Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose\n  Were in the yes and no discordant made.\n\nPreceded there the vessel benedight,\n  Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,\n  And more and less than King was he in this.\n\nOpposite, represented at the window\n  Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,\n  Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.\n\nI moved my feet from where I had been standing,\n  To examine near at hand another story,\n  Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.\n\nThere the high glory of the Roman Prince\n  Was chronicled, whose great beneficence\n  Moved Gregory to his great victory;\n\n'Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;\n  And a poor widow at his bridle stood,\n  In attitude of weeping and of grief.\n\nAround about him seemed it thronged and full\n  Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold\n  Above them visibly in the wind were moving.\n\nThe wretched woman in the midst of these\n  Seemed to be saying: \"Give me vengeance, Lord,\n  For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.\"\n\nAnd he to answer her: \"Now wait until\n  I shall return.\"  And she: \"My Lord,\" like one\n  In whom grief is impatient, \"shouldst thou not\n\nReturn?\"  And he: \"Who shall be where I am\n  Will give it thee.\"  And she: \"Good deed of others\n  What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?\"\n\nWhence he: \"Now comfort thee, for it behoves me\n  That I discharge my duty ere I move;\n  Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.\"\n\nHe who on no new thing has ever looked\n  Was the creator of this visible language,\n  Novel to us, for here it is not found.\n\nWhile I delighted me in contemplating\n  The images of such humility,\n  And dear to look on for their Maker's sake,\n\n\"Behold, upon this side, but rare they make\n  Their steps,\" the Poet murmured, \"many people;\n  These will direct us to the lofty stairs.\"\n\nMine eyes, that in beholding were intent\n  To see new things, of which they curious are,\n  In turning round towards him were not slow.\n\nBut still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve\n  From thy good purposes, because thou hearest\n  How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;\n\nAttend not to the fashion of the torment,\n  Think of what follows; think that at the worst\n  It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.\n\n\"Master,\" began I, \"that which I behold\n  Moving towards us seems to me not persons,\n  And what I know not, so in sight I waver.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"The grievous quality\n  Of this their torment bows them so to earth,\n  That my own eyes at first contended with it;\n\nBut look there fixedly, and disentangle\n  By sight what cometh underneath those stones;\n  Already canst thou see how each is stricken.\"\n\nO ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!\n  Who, in the vision of the mind infirm\n  Confidence have in your backsliding steps,\n\nDo ye not comprehend that we are worms,\n  Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly\n  That flieth unto judgment without screen?\n\nWhy floats aloft your spirit high in air?\n  Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,\n  Even as the worm in whom formation fails!\n\nAs to sustain a ceiling or a roof,\n  In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure\n  Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,\n\nWhich makes of the unreal real anguish\n  Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus\n  Beheld I those, when I had ta'en good heed.\n\nTrue is it, they were more or less bent down,\n  According as they more or less were laden;\n  And he who
