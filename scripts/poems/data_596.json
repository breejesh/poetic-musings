She was starting down,\nLooking back over her shoulder at some fear.\nShe took a doubtful step and then undid it\nTo raise herself and look again.  He spoke\nAdvancing toward her:  'What is it you see\nFrom up there always--for I want to know.'\nShe turned and sank upon her skirts at that,\nAnd her face changed from terrified to dull.\nHe said to gain time:  'What is it you see,'\nMounting until she cowered under him.\n'I will find out now--you must tell me, dear.'\nShe, in her place, refused him any help\nWith the least stiffening of her neck and silence.\nShe let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,\nBlind creature; and awhile he didn't see.\nBut at last he murmured, 'Oh,' and again, 'Oh.'\n\n'What is it--what?' she said.\n\t\t\t\t\t'Just that I see.'\n\n'You don't,' she challenged.  'Tell me what it is.'\n\n'The wonder is I didn't see at once.\nI never noticed it from here before.\nI must be wonted to it--that's the reason.\nThe little graveyard where my people are!\nSo small the window frames the whole of it.\nNot so much larger than a bedroom, is it?\nThere are three stones of slate and one of marble,\nBroad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight\nOn the sidehill.  We haven't to mind those.\nBut I understand:  it is not the stones,\nBut the child's mound--'\n\n\t\t\t\t'Don't, don't, don't, don't,' she cried.\n\nShe withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm\nThat rested on the bannister, and slid downstairs;\nAnd turned on him with such a daunting look,\nHe said twice over before he knew himself:\n'Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?'\n\n'Not you!  Oh, where's my hat?  Oh, I don't need it!\nI must get out of here.  I must get air.\nI don't know rightly whether any man can.'\n\n'Amy!  Don't go to someone else this time.\nListen to me.  I won't come down the stairs.'\nHe sat and fixed his chin between his fists.\n'There's something I should like to ask you, dear.'\n\n'You don't know how to ask it.'\n\n\t\t\t\t\t'Help me, then.'\n\nHer fingers moved the latch for all reply.\n\n'My words are nearly always an offense.\nI don't know how to speak of anything\nSo as to please you.  But I might be taught\nI should suppose.  I can't say I see how.\nA man must partly give up being a man\nWith women-folk.  We could have some arrangement\nBy which I'd bind myself to keep hands off\nAnything special you're a-mind to name.\nThough I don't like such things 'twixt those that love.\nTwo that don't love can't live together without them.\nBut two that do can't live together with them.'\nShe moved the latch a little.  'Don't--don't go.\nDon't carry it to someone else this time.\nTell me about it if it's something human.\nLet me into your grief.  I'm not so much\nUnlike other folks as your standing there\nApart would make me out.  Give me my chance.\nI do think, though, you overdo it a little.\nWhat was it brought you up to think it the thing\nTo take your mother--loss of a first child\nSo inconsolably--in the face of love.\nYou'd think his memory might be satisfied--'\n\n'There you go sneering now!'\n\n\t\t\t\t\t'I'm not, I'm not!\nYou make me angry.  I'll come down to you.\nGod, what a woman!  And it's come to this,\nA man can't speak of his own child that's dead.'\n\n'You can't because you don't know how to speak.\nIf you had any feelings, you that dug\nWith your own hand--how could you?--his little grave;\nI saw you from that very window there,\nMaking the gravel leap and leap in air,\nLeap up, like that, like that, and land so lightly\nAnd roll back down the mound beside the hole.\nI thought, Who is that man?  I didn't know you.\nAnd I crept down the stairs and up the stairs\nTo look again, and still your spade kept lifting.\nThen you came in.  I heard your rumbling voice\nOut in the kitchen, and I don't know why,\nBut I went near to see with my own eyes.\nYou could sit there with the stains on your shoes\nOf the fresh earth from your own baby's grave\nAnd talk about your everyday concerns.\nYou had stood the spade up against the wall\nOutside there in the entry, for I saw it.'\n\n'I shall laugh the worst laugh I ever laughed.\nI'm cursed.  God, if I don't believe I'm cursed.'\n\n'I can repeat the very words you were saying.\n\"Three foggy mornings and one rainy day\nWill rot the best birch fence a man can build.\"\nThink of it, talk like that at such a time!\nWhat had how long it takes a birch to rot\nTo do with what was in the darkened parlor.\nYou couldn't care!  The nearest friends can go\nWith anyone to death, comes so far short\nThey might as well not try to go at all.\nNo, from the time when one is sick to death,\nOne is alone, and he dies more alone.\nFriends make pretense of following to the grave,\nBut before one is in it, their minds are turned\nAnd making the best of their way back to life\nAnd living people, and things they understand.\nBut the world's evil.  I won't have grief so\nIf I can change it.  Oh, I won't, I won't!'\n\n'There, you have said it all and you feel better.\nYou won't go now.  You're crying.  Close the door.\nThe heart's gone out of it:  why keep it up.\nAmy!  There's someone coming down the road!'\n\n'You--oh, you think the talk is all.  I must go--\nSomewhere out of this house.  How can I make you--'\n\n'If--you--do!'  She was opening the door wider.\n'Where do you mean to go?  First tell me that.\nI'll follow and bring you back by force.

class=\"long-line\">1</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I sing the body electric, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Was it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">2</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The expression of the face balks account,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and from the heave of the water,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horse-man in his saddle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The female soothing a child, the farmer\u2019s daughter in the garden or cow-yard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown after work,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv\u2019d neck and the counting;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such-like I love\u2014I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother\u2019s breast with the little child,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">3</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This man was a wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He drank water only, the blood show\u2019d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail\u2019d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">4</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I have perceiv\u2019d that to be with those I like is enough,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">5</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This is the female form,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear\u2019d of hell, are now consumed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious nice,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Undulating into the willing and yielding day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh\u2019d day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This the nucleus\u2014after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The female contains all qualities and tempers them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She is all things duly veil\u2019d, she is both passive and active,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">As I see my soul reflected in Nature,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">6</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He too is all qualities, he is action and power,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The flush of the known universe is in him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The man\u2019s body is sacred and the woman\u2019s body is sacred,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No matter who it is, it is sacred\u2014is it the meanest one in the laborers\u2019 gang?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each has his or her place in the procession.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">(All is a procession,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For you only, and not for him and her?</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">7</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A man\u2019s body at auction,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gentlemen look on this wonder,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll\u2019d.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In this head the all-baffling brain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In it and below it the makings of heroes.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They shall be stript that you may see them.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And wonders within there yet.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Within there runs blood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The same old blood! the same red-running blood!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Do you think they are not there because they are not express\u2019d in parlors and lecture-rooms?)</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In him the start of populous states and rich republics,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?)</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">8</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A woman\u2019s body at auction,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Have you ever loved the body of a woman?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Have you ever loved the body of a man?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. </span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">9</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">O my body!
