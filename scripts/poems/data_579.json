This is not to suggest no one died. When I was eight my mother became pregnant. She went to the hospital to give birth and returned without the baby. Where's the baby? we asked. Did she shrug? She was the kind of woman who liked to shrug; deep within her was an everlasting shrug. That didn't seem like a death. The years went by and people only died on television\u2014if they weren't Black, they were wearing black or were terminally ill. Then I returned home from school one day and saw my father sitting on the steps of our home. He had a look that was unfamiliar; it was flooded, so leaking. I climbed the steps as far away from him as I could get. He was breaking or broken. Or, to be more precise, he looked to me like someone understanding his aloneness. Loneliness. His mother was dead. I'd never met her. It meant a trip back home for him. When he returned he spoke neither about the airplane nor the funeral.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Every movie I saw while in the third grade compelled me to ask, Is he dead? Is she dead? Because the characters often live against all odds it is the actors whose mortality concerned me. If it were an old, black-and-white film, whoever was around would answer yes. Months later the actor would show up on some latenight talk show to promote his latest efforts. I would turn and say\u2014one always turns to say\u2014You said he was dead. And the misinformed would claim, I never said he was dead. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. Inevitably we get older; whoever is still with us says, Stop asking me that.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Or one begins asking oneself that same question differently. Am I dead? Though this question at no time explicitly translates into Should I be dead, eventually the suicide hotline is called. You are, as usual, watching television, the eight-o'clock movie, when a number flashes on the screen: I-800-SUICIDE. You dial the number. Do you feel like killing yourself? the man on the other end of the receiver asks. You tell him, I feel like I am already dead. When he makes no response you add, I am in death's position. He finally says, Don't believe what you are thinking and feeling. Then he asks, Where do you live?</p><p>Fifteen minutes later the doorbell rings. You explain to the ambulance attendant that you had a momentary lapse of happily. The noun, happiness, is a static state of some Platonic ideal you know better than to pursue. Your modifying process had happily or unhappily experienced a momentary pause. This kind of thing happens, perhaps is still happening. He shrugs and in turn explains that you need to come quietly or he will have to restrain you. If he is forced to restrain you, he will have to report that he is forced to restrain you. It is this simple: Resistance will only make matters more difficult. Any resistance will only make matters worse. By law, I will have to restrain you. His tone suggests that you should try to understand the difficulty in which he finds himself. This is further disorienting. I am fine! Can't you see that! You climb into the ambulance unassisted.</p> "}, {"title": "The Nailhead (audio only)", "view_node": "/poem/nailhead-audio-only", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/david-ignatow\" hreflang=\"und\">David Ignatow</a>", "field_date_published": "1964", "body": " <p>\u00a0</p><p>Click the icon above to listen to this audio poem.</p> "}, {"title": "Epithalamium", "view_node": "/poem/epithalamium", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/matthew-rohrer\" hreflang=\"und\">Matthew Rohrer</a>", "field_date_published": "2001", "body": " <p>In the middle garden is the secret wedding,<br />that hides always under the other one<br />and under the shiny things of the other one.

The last baseball players \nSwarmed around a tiny diamond template; \nMan and his games a perfected miniature\u2014\nLike the past you almost don't believe in. \nYet it's there, behind perhaps a blue veil; \nSturdy; calm; unless put out of countenance \nBy drab standards of exactitude. \nThe last word was never, was always \nAbout to be written; so that none of us \nCould know whether hope, become action, \nExposed to the elements\u2014a bronze monument, \nNegligible among the surrounding towers,\nBut somehow truly central\u2014would corrode, \nCrumble, dissolve; or weather into \nA fact of nature, continue to be. </pre>\n "}, {"title": "A Song for Many Movements ", "view_node": "/poem/song-many-movements", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/audre-lorde\" hreflang=\"und\">Audre Lorde</a>", "field_date_published": "1978", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Nobody wants\u00a0to die on the way</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">caught between ghosts of whiteness</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and the real water</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">none of us wanted to leave</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">our bones</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on the way to salvation</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">three planets to the left</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a century of light years ago</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">our spices are separate and particular</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but our skins sing in complimentary keys</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">at a quarter to eight mean time</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">we were telling the same stories</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">over and over and over.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Broken down gods survive</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the crevasses and mudpots</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of every beleaguered city</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">where it is obvious</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">there are too many bodies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to cart to the ovens</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or gallows</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and our uses have become</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">more important than our silence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">after the fall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">too many empty cases</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of blood to bury or burn</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and there will be no body left</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to listen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and our labor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">has become more important</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">than our silence</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Our labor has become</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">more important</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">than our silence.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Speaking In Tongues", "view_node": "/poem/speaking-tongues", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/mary-rose-oreilley\" hreflang=\"und\">Mary Rose O&#039;Reilley</a>", "field_date_published": "2005", "body": " <pre>\nI go to church every Sunday\nthough I don\u2019t believe a word of it,\nbecause the longing for God\nis a prayer said in the bones.\n\nWhen people call on Jesus\nI move to a place in the body\nwhere such words rise,\none of the valleys\nwhere hope pins itself to desire;\nwe have so much landscape like that\nyou\u2019d think we were made \nto sustain a cry.\n\nWhen the old men around me\nlift their hands\nas though someone has cornered them,\ngiving it all away,\nI remember a dock on the estuary,\nwatching a heron get airborne against the odds.\nIt\u2019s the transitional moment that baffles me\u2014\nhow she composes her rickety\ngrocery cart of a body\nto make that flight.\n\nThe pine siskin, stalled on a windy coast,\nremembers the woods\nshe will long for when needs arise; so\nthe boreal forest composes itself in my mind:\nfirst as a rift, absence, \nthen in a tumble of words\nundone from sense, like the stutter\nyou hear  when somebody falls\nover the cliff of language.
