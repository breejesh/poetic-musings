And a light.<br />Have we a piece of candle if the lamp<br />And oil are buried out of reach?\u201d<br />Again<br />The house was full of tramping, and the dark,<br />Door-filling men burst in and seized the stove.<br />A cannon-mouth-like hole was in the wall,<br />To which they set it true by eye; and then<br />Came up the jointed stovepipe in their hands,<br />So much too light and airy for their strength<br />It almost seemed to come ballooning up,<br />Slipping from clumsy clutches toward the ceiling.<br />\u201cA fit!\u201d said one, and banged a stovepipe shoulder.<br />\u201cIt\u2019s good luck when you move in to begin<br />With good luck with your stovepipe. Never mind,<br />It\u2019s not so bad in the country, settled down,<br />When people \u2019re getting on in life, You\u2019ll like it.\u201d<br />Joe said: \u201cYou big boys ought to find a farm,<br />And make good farmers, and leave other fellows<br />The city work to do. There\u2019s not enough<br />For everybody as it is in there.\u201d<br />\u201cGod!\u201d one said wildly, and, when no one spoke:<br />\u201cSay that to Jimmy here. He needs a farm.\u201d<br />But Jimmy only made his jaw recede<br />Fool-like, and rolled his eyes as if to say<br />He saw himself a farmer. Then there was a French boy<br />Who said with seriousness that made them laugh,<br />\u201cMa friend, you ain\u2019t know what it is you\u2019re ask.\u201d<br />He doffed his cap and held it with both hands<br />Across his chest to make as \u2019twere a bow:<br />\u201cWe\u2019re giving you our chances on de farm.\u201d<br />And then they all turned to with deafening boots<br />And put each other bodily out of the house.<br />\u201cGoodby to them! We puzzle them. They think\u2014<br />I don\u2019t know what they think we see in what<br />They leave us to: that pasture slope that seems<br />The back some farm presents us; and your woods<br />To northward from your window at the sink,<br />Waiting to steal a step on us whenever<br />We drop our eyes or turn to other things,<br />As in the game \u2018Ten-step\u2019 the children play.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cGood boys they seemed, and let them love the city.<br />All they could say was \u2018God!\u2019 when you proposed<br />Their coming out and making useful farmers.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cDid they make something lonesome go through you?<br />It would take more than them to sicken you\u2014<br />Us of our bargain. But they left us so<br />As to our fate, like fools past reasoning with.<br />They almost shook me.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s all so much<br />What we have always wanted, I confess<br />It\u2019s seeming bad for a moment makes it seem<br />Even worse still, and so on down, down, down.<br />It\u2019s nothing; it\u2019s their leaving us at dusk.<br />I never bore it well when people went.<br />The first night after guests have gone, the house<br />Seems haunted or exposed. I always take<br />A personal interest in the locking up<br />At bedtime; but the strangeness soon wears off.\u201d<br />He fetched a dingy lantern from behind<br />A door. \u201cThere\u2019s that we didn\u2019t lose!

He\u2019ll plan for us and plan<br />To help us, but he\u2019ll take it out in planning.<br />Well, you can set the table with the loaf.<br />Let\u2019s see you find your loaf.

It can\u2019t be helped though:<br />Pressed into service means pressed out of shape.<br />Somehow I\u2019ll make it right with her\u2014she\u2019ll see.<br />She\u2019s going to do my scouting in the field,<br />Over stone walls and all along a wood<br />And by a river bank for water flowers,<br />The floating Heart, with small leaf like a heart,<br />And at the <em>sinus</em> under water a fist<br />Of little fingers all kept down but one,<br />And that thrust up to blossom in the sun<br />As if to say, \u2018You! You\u2019re the Heart\u2019s desire.\u2019<br />Anne has a way with flowers to take the place<br />Of that she\u2019s lost: she goes down on one knee<br />And lifts their faces by the chin to hers<br />And says their names, and leaves them where they are.\u201d<br /><br />The lawyer wore a watch the case of which<br />Was cunningly devised to make a noise<br />Like a small pistol when he snapped it shut<br />At such a time as this.

John\u2019s been fair<br />I take it. What was his was always hers.<br />There was no quarrel about property.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cReason enough, there was no property.<br />A friend or two as good as own the farm,<br />Such as it is.

I\u2019m not blaming him.<br />Take it year in, year out, he doesn\u2019t make much.<br />We came here for a home for me, you know,<br />Estelle to do the housework for the board<br />Of both of us. But look how it turns out:<br />She seems to have the housework, and besides,<br />Half of the outdoor work, though as for that,<br />He\u2019d say she does it more because she likes it.<br />You see our pretty things are all outdoors.<br />Our hens and cows and pigs are always better<br />Than folks like us have any business with.<br />Farmers around twice as well off as we<br />Haven\u2019t as good. They don\u2019t go with the farm.<br />One thing you can\u2019t help liking about John,<br />He\u2019s fond of nice things\u2014too fond, some would say.<br />But Estelle don\u2019t complain: she\u2019s like him there.<br />She wants our hens to be the best there are.<br />You never saw this room before a show,<br />Full of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds<br />In separate coops, having their plumage done.<br />The smell of the wet feathers in the heat!<br />You spoke of John\u2019s not being safe to stay with.<br />You don\u2019t know what a gentle lot we are:<br />We wouldn\u2019t hurt a hen! You ought to see us<br />Moving a flock of hens from place to place.<br />We\u2019re not allowed to take them upside down,<br />All we can hold together by the legs.<br />Two at a time\u2019s the rule, one on each arm,<br />No matter how far and how many times<br />We have to go.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou mean that\u2019s John\u2019s idea.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cAnd we live up to it; or I don\u2019t know<br />What childishness he wouldn\u2019t give way to.<br />He manages to keep the upper hand<br />On his own farm. He\u2019s boss. But as to hens:<br />We fence our flowers in and the hens range.<br />Nothing\u2019s too good for them. We say it pays.<br />John likes to tell the offers he has had,<br />Twenty for this cock, twenty-five for that.<br />He never takes the money. If they\u2019re worth<br />That much to sell, they\u2019re worth as much to keep.<br />Bless you, it\u2019s all expense, though. Reach me down<br />The little tin box on the cupboard shelf,<br />The upper shelf, the tin box. That\u2019s the one.<br />I\u2019ll show you. Here you are.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cA bill\u2014<br />For fifty dollars for one Langshang cock\u2014<br />Receipted. And the cock is in the yard.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cNot in a glass case, then?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cHe\u2019d need a tall one:<br />He can eat off a barrel from the ground.<br />He\u2019s been in a glass case, as you may say,<br />The Crystal Palace, London. He\u2019s imported.<br />John bought him, and we paid the bill with beads\u2014<br />Wampum, I call it. Mind, we don\u2019t complain.<br />But you see, don\u2019t you, we take care of him.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cAnd like it, too. It makes it all the worse.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt seems as if. And that\u2019s not all: he\u2019s helpless<br />In ways that I can hardly tell you of.<br />Sometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts<br />To see where all the money goes so fast.<br />You know how men will be ridiculous.<br />But it\u2019s just fun the way he gets bedeviled\u2014<br />If he\u2019s untidy now, what will he be\u2014\u2014?<br /><br />\u201cIt makes it all the worse. You must be blind.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cEstelle\u2019s the one. You needn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cCan\u2019t you and I get to the root of it?<br />What\u2019s the real trouble? What will satisfy her?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s as I say: she\u2019s turned from him, that\u2019s all.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cBut why, when she\u2019s well off? Is it the neighbours,<br />Being cut off from friends?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWe have our friends.<br />That isn\u2019t it. Folks aren\u2019t afraid of us.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cShe\u2019s let it worry her. You stood the strain,<br />And you\u2019re her mother.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cBut I didn\u2019t always.<br />I didn\u2019t relish it along at first.<br />But I got wonted to it. And besides\u2014<br />John said I was too old to have grandchildren.<br />But what\u2019s the use of talking when it\u2019s done?<br />She won\u2019t come back\u2014it\u2019s worse than that\u2014she can\u2019t.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhy do you speak like that? What do you know?<br />What do you mean?\u2014she\u2019s done harm to herself?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI mean she\u2019s married\u2014married someone else.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cOho, oho!\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYes, I do,<br />Only too well. I knew there must be something!<br />So that was what was back. She\u2019s bad, that\u2019s all!\u201d<br /><br />\u201cBad to get married when she had the chance?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cNonsense! See what\u2019s she done! But who, who\u2014\u2014\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWho\u2019d marry her straight out of such a mess?<br />Say it right out\u2014no matter for her mother.<br />The man was found. I\u2019d better name no names.<br />John himself won\u2019t imagine who he is.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cThen it\u2019s all up. I think I\u2019ll get away.<br />You\u2019ll be expecting John. I pity Estelle;<br />I suppose she deserves some pity, too.<br />You ought to have the kitchen to yourself<br />To break it to him. You may have the job.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou needn\u2019t think you\u2019re going to get away.<br />John\u2019s almost here. I\u2019ve had my eye on someone<br />Coming down Ryan\u2019s Hill. I thought \u2019twas him.<br />Here he is now. This box! Put it away.<br />And this bill.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhat\u2019s the hurry? He\u2019ll unhitch.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cNo, he won\u2019t, either. He\u2019ll just drop the reins<br />And turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all.<br />She won\u2019t get far before the wheels hang up<br />On something\u2014there\u2019s no harm.

They laughed together.<br />\u201cStark?\u201d he inquired. \u201cNo matter for the proof.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYes, Stark. And you?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI\u2019m Stark.\u201d He drew his passport.<br /><br />\u201cYou know we might not be and still be cousins:<br />The town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys,<br />All claiming some priority in Starkness.<br />My mother was a Lane, yet might have married<br />Anyone upon earth and still her children<br />Would have been Starks, and doubtless here to-day.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou riddle with your genealogy<br />Like a Viola. I don\u2019t follow you.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI only mean my mother was a Stark<br />Several times over, and by marrying father<br />No more than brought us back into the name.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cOne ought not to be thrown into confusion<br />By a plain statement of relationship,<br />But I own what you say makes my head spin.<br />You take my card\u2014you seem so good at such things\u2014<br />And see if you can reckon our cousinship.<br />Why not take seats here on the cellar wall<br />And dangle feet among the raspberry vines?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cUnder the shelter of the family tree.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cJust so\u2014that ought to be enough protection.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cNot from the rain. I think it\u2019s going to rain.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s raining.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cNo, it\u2019s misting; let\u2019s be fair.<br />Does the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?\u201d<br /><br />The situation was like this: the road<br />Bowed outward on the mountain half-way up,<br />And disappeared and ended not far off.<br />No one went home that way. The only house<br />Beyond where they were was a shattered seedpod.<br />And below roared a brook hidden in trees,<br />The sound of which was silence for the place.<br />This he sat listening to till she gave judgment.<br /><br />\u201cOn father\u2019s side, it seems, we\u2019re\u2014let me see\u2014\u2014\u201d<br /><br />\u201cDon\u2019t be too technical.\u2014You have three cards.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cFour cards, one yours, three mine, one for each branch<br />Of the Stark family I\u2019m a member of.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cD\u2019you know a person so related to herself<br />Is supposed to be mad.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI may be mad.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou look so, sitting out here in the rain<br />Studying genealogy with me<br />You never saw before. What will we come to<br />With all this pride of ancestry, we Yankees?<br />I think we\u2019re all mad. Tell me why we\u2019re here<br />Drawn into town about this cellar hole<br />Like wild geese on a lake before a storm?<br />What do we see in such a hole, I wonder.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cThe Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc,<br />Which means The Seven Caves that We Came out of.<br />This is the pit from which we Starks were digged.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou must be learned. That\u2019s what you see in it?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cAnd what do you see?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYes, what do I see?<br />First let me look. I see raspberry vines\u2014\u201d<br /><br />\u201cOh, if you\u2019re going to use your eyes, just hear<br />What I see. It\u2019s a little, little boy,<br />As pale and dim as a match flame in the sun;<br />He\u2019s groping in the cellar after jam,<br />He thinks it\u2019s dark and it\u2019s flooded with daylight.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cHe\u2019s nothing. Listen. When I lean like this<br />I can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly,\u2014<br />With his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug\u2014<br />Bless you, it isn\u2019t Grandsir Stark, it\u2019s Granny,<br />But the pipe\u2019s there and smoking and the jug.<br />She\u2019s after cider, the old girl, she\u2019s thirsty;<br />Here\u2019s hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cTell me about her. Does she look like me?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cShe should, shouldn\u2019t she, you\u2019re so many times<br />Over descended from her. I believe<br />She does look like you. Stay the way you are.<br />The nose is just the same, and so\u2019s the chin\u2014<br />Making allowance, making due allowance.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou poor, dear, great, great, great, great Granny!\u201d<br /><br />\u201cSee that you get her greatness right. Don\u2019t stint her.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYes, it\u2019s important, though you think it isn\u2019t.<br />I won\u2019t be teased. But see how wet I am.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYes, you must go; we can\u2019t stay here for ever.<br />But wait until I give you a hand up.<br />A bead of silver water more or less<br />Strung on your hair won\u2019t hurt your summer looks.<br />I wanted to try something with the noise<br />That the brook raises in the empty valley.<br />We have seen visions\u2014now consult the voices.<br />Something I must have learned riding in trains<br />When I was young. I used the roar<br />To set the voices speaking out of it,<br />Speaking or singing, and the band-music playing.<br />Perhaps you have the art of what I mean.<br />I\u2019ve never listened in among the sounds<br />That a brook makes in such a wild descent.<br />It ought to give a purer oracle.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt\u2019s as you throw a picture on a screen:<br />The meaning of it all is out of you;<br />The voices give you what you wish to hear.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cStrangely, it\u2019s anything they wish to give.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cThen I don\u2019t know. It must be strange enough.<br />I wonder if it\u2019s not your make-believe.<br />What do you think you\u2019re like to hear to-day?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cFrom the sense of our having been together\u2014<br />But why take time for what I\u2019m like to hear?<br />I\u2019ll tell you what the voices really say.<br />You will do very well right where you are<br />A little longer. I mustn\u2019t feel too hurried,<br />Or I can\u2019t give myself to hear the voices.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIs this some trance you are withdrawing into?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou must be very still; you mustn\u2019t talk.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI\u2019ll hardly breathe.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cThe voices seem to say\u2014\u2014\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cDon\u2019t! The voices seem to say:<br />Call her Nausicaa, the unafraid<br />Of an acquaintance made adventurously.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI let you say that\u2014on consideration.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI don\u2019t see very well how you can help it.<br />You want the truth. I speak but by the voices.<br />You see they know I haven\u2019t had your name,<br />Though what a name should matter between us\u2014\u2014\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI shall suspect\u2014\u2014\u201d<br /><br />\u201cBe good. The voices say:<br />Call her Nausicaa, and take a timber<br />That you shall find lies in the cellar charred<br />Among the raspberries, and hew and shape it<br />For a door-sill or other corner piece<br />In a new cottage on the ancient spot.<br />The life is not yet all gone out of it.<br />And come and make your summer dwelling here,<br />And perhaps she will come, still unafraid,<br />And sit before you in the open door<br />With flowers in her lap until they fade,<br />But not come in across the sacred sill\u2014\u2014\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI wonder where your oracle is tending.<br />You can see that there\u2019s something wrong with it,<br />Or it would speak in dialect. Whose voice<br />Does it purport to speak in? Not old Grandsir\u2019s<br />Nor Granny\u2019s, surely. Call up one of them.<br />They have best right to be heard in this place.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou seem so partial to our great-grandmother<br />(Nine times removed. Correct me if I err.)<br />You will be likely to regard as sacred<br />Anything she may say. But let me warn you,<br />Folks in her day were given to plain speaking.<br />You think you\u2019d best tempt her at such a time?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt rests with us always to cut her off.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWell then, it\u2019s Granny speaking: \u2018I dunnow!<br />Mebbe I\u2019m wrong to take it as I do.<br />There ain\u2019t no names quite like the old ones though,<br />Nor never will be to my way of thinking.<br />One mustn\u2019t bear too hard on the new comers,<br />But there\u2019s a dite too many of them for comfort.<br />I should feel easier if I could see<br />More of the salt wherewith they\u2019re to be salted.<br />Son, you do as you\u2019re told! You take the timber\u2014<br />It\u2019s as sound as the day when it was cut\u2014<br />And begin over\u2014\u2014\u2019 There, she\u2019d better stop.<br />You can see what is troubling Granny, though.<br />But don\u2019t you think we sometimes make too much<br />Of the old stock? What counts is the ideals,<br />And those will bear some keeping still about.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI can see we are going to be good friends.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI like your \u2018going to be.\u2019 You said just now<br />It\u2019s going to rain.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cI know, and it was raining.<br />I let you say all that. But I must go now.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou let me say it? on consideration?<br />How shall we say good-bye in such a case?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cHow shall we?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWill you leave the way to me?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cNo, I don\u2019t trust your eyes. You\u2019ve said enough.<br />Now give me your hand up.\u2014Pick me that flower.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWhere shall we meet again?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cNowhere but here<br />Once more before we meet elsewhere.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIn rain?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cIt ought to be in rain.

No one liked the boss.<br />He was one of the kind sports call a spider,<br />All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy<br />From a humped body nigh as big\u2019s a biscuit.<br />But work! that man could work, especially<br />If by so doing he could get more work<br />Out of his hired help. I\u2019m not denying<br />He was hard on himself. I couldn\u2019t find<br />That he kept any hours\u2014not for himself.<br />Daylight and lantern-light were one to him:<br />I\u2019ve heard him pounding in the barn all night.<br />But what he liked was someone to encourage.<br />Them that he couldn\u2019t lead he\u2019d get behind<br />And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing\u2014<br />Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.<br />I\u2019d seen about enough of his bulling tricks<br />(We call that bulling). I\u2019d been watching him.<br />So when he paired off with me in the hayfield<br />To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble.<br />I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders<br />Combed it down with a rake and says, \u2018O. K.\u2019<br />Everything went well till we reached the barn<br />With a big catch to empty in a bay.<br />You understand that meant the easy job<br />For the man up on top of throwing <em>down</em><br />The hay and rolling it off wholesale,<br />Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting.<br />You wouldn\u2019t think a fellow\u2019d need much urging<br />Under these circumstances, would you now?<br />But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,<br />And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,<br />Shouts like an army captain, \u2018Let her come!\u2019<br />Thinks I, D\u2019ye mean it? \u2018What was that you said?\u2019<br />I asked out loud, so\u2019s there\u2019d be no mistake,<br />\u2018Did you say, Let her come?\u2019 \u2018Yes, let her come.\u2019<br />He said it over, but he said it softer.<br />Never you say a thing like that to a man,<br />Not if he values what he is. God, I\u2019d as soon<br />Murdered him as left out his middle name.<br />I\u2019d built the load and knew right where to find it.<br />Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for<br />Like meditating, and then I just dug in<br />And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots.<br />I looked over the side once in the dust<br />And caught sight of him treading-water-like,<br />Keeping his head above. \u2018Damn ye,\u2019 I says,<br />\u2018That gets ye!\u2019 He squeaked like a squeezed rat.<br />That was the last I saw or heard of him.<br />I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.<br />As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck,<br />And sort of waiting to be asked about it,<br />One of the boys sings out, \u2018Where\u2019s the old man?\u2019<br />\u2018I left him in the barn under the hay.<br />If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.\u2019<br />They realized from the way I swobbed my neck<br />More than was needed something must be up.<br />They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.<br />They told me afterward. First they forked hay,<br />A lot of it, out into the barn floor.<br />Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle.<br />I guess they thought I\u2019d spiked him in the temple<br />Before I buried him, or I couldn\u2019t have managed.<br />They excavated more. \u2018Go keep his wife<br />Out of the barn.\u2019 Someone looked in a window,<br />And curse me if he wasn\u2019t in the kitchen<br />Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet<br />Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.<br />He looked so clean disgusted from behind<br />There was no one that dared to stir him up,<br />Or let him know that he was being looked at.<br />Apparently I hadn\u2019t buried him<br />(I may have knocked him down); but my just trying<br />To bury him had hurt his dignity.<br />He had gone to the house so\u2019s not to meet me.<br />He kept away from us all afternoon.<br />We tended to his hay. We saw him out<br />After a while picking peas in his garden:<br />He couldn\u2019t keep away from doing something.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cWeren\u2019t you relieved to find he wasn\u2019t dead?\u201d<br /><br />\u201cNo! and yet I don\u2019t know\u2014it\u2019s hard to say.<br />I went about to kill him fair enough.\u201d<br /><br />\u201cYou took an awkward way.

Neither slavish nor stern.<br />Not magnificent, but not the kind made to crumple in shame.<br />Not prudish.\u00a0 Unwilling to arch and beckon like a whore\u2019s.\u00a0<br />They skitter away from certainties like <em>alive</em> or <em>dead</em>.\u00a0<br />My self-portrait hangs on the narrow wall,<br />And I kneel down to it every day.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You didn\u2019t come to live with me.<br />\u00a0</p><p>5.\u00a0 Impromptu Party</p><p>The little table is draped with a festive cloth, and<br />Light blurs out from a single lamp, making us fuzzy.</p><p>A sip of red wine, and I rise to my feet. We are<br />Dancing, my guests and I, like kids in a ballroom.</p><p>We don\u2019t smile or even speak.\u00a0<br />We\u2019ve had a lot to drink.</p><p>To a single woman, time is like a scrap of meat:<br />Nothing you can afford to give away.

Sunday Alone</p><p>I don\u2019t picnic on Sundays.<br />Parks are a sad song; I steer clear.<br />But I dug out all my sheet music,<br />I lolled about in the Turkish Bath<br />Singing from breakfast to tea.<br />With my hair, I sang <em>Do</em><br />And my eyes, <em>Re</em><br />And my ear sounded <em>Mi</em><br />And my nose went after <em>Fa</em><br />My face tilted back and out rose <em>So</em><br />My mouth breathed <em>La</em><br />My whole body birthed <em>Ti</em><br />Like my cousin said, famously\u2014<br /><em>Music is the soul sighing</em>.<br />Music pushes back against pain.<br />Solitude is great (but I don\u2019t want<br />Greatness).

Dream of Symbolism</p><p>I occupy the walls that surround me.<br />When did I become so rectilinear?<br />I had a rectilinear dream:<br />The rectilinear sky in Leo:<br />The head, for a while, shone brightest.<br />Next the tail.\u00a0 After a while<br />It became a wild horse<br />Galloping into the distances of the universe,<br />Lasso dragging behind, tethered to nothing.<br />There are no roads in the black night that contains us.<br />Every step is a step into absence.<br />I don\u2019t remember the last time I saw<br />A free soul.

I re-read the paper.<br />The ban on smoking underway<br />Has gotten a bonfire of support. A heated topic,<br />Though I find it inflammatory. Authority<br />Flings a struck match in our direction, then<br />Gasps when we flare into flame.

Thinking<br />What I am afraid to say keeps fear<br />And fear\u2019s twin, rage, at bay. Law<br />Squints out from its burrow, jams<br />Its quiver with arrows. It shoots<br />Like it thinks: never straight. My thoughts<br />Escape. One day, they\u2019ll emigrate<br />To a kingdom far-off and heady.<br />My visa\u2019s in-process, though like anyone,<br />I worry it\u2019s overpopulated already.<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You didn\u2019t come to live with me.</p><p>14.\u00a0 Hope</p><p>This city of riches has fallen empty.<br />Small rooms like mine are easy to breech.<br />Watchmen pace, peer in, gazes hungry.<br />I come and go, always alone, heavy with worry.<br />My flesh forsakes itself.

If you come,<br />Will nation rise against nation? If you come,<br />Will the Yellow River drown its banks?<br />If you come, will the sky blacken and rage?<br />Will your coming decimate the harvest?<br />There is nothing I can do in the face of all I hate.<br />What I hate most is the person I\u2019ve become.<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You didn\u2019t come to live with me.</p> "}], "pager": {"current_page": 231, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
