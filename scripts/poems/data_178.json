curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\n<span class=\"long-line\">Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,</span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,</span>\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\n<span
