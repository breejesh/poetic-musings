every new condition from the beginning,\nAs in the autumn leaf and summer prime.\nTherefore he chose to live the only game\nWorthy of repetition, in the likeness\nOf someone like himself, a race of which\nHe was the changing distances and ground,\nThe runners, and the goal that runs away\nForever into time; or like two players\nAt odds in white and black, their dignities\nTriumphs refused or losses unredeemed.\nFor the one, that it be ever of the pure\nIntention that he witnessed in the high\nStained windows of King's Chapel--ancestral stories,\nThe old above the new, like pages shining\nFrom an essential book--he taught his mind\nTo imitate the meditation, sovereign\nIn verse and prose, of those who shared with him\nIntelligence of beauty, good, and truth\nAs one, unchanging and unchangeable,\nDisinterested excitement through a sentence\nTheir joy and passion. For the other, as\nA venturer asleep, he went among\nThe voiceless and unvisionary many--\nLike one who offers blood to know his fate\nOr hold his twin again--deep in the midnight\nBaths of New Orleans, on its plural beds\nAnd on the secret banks beside its river,\nThe many who, anonymous as he was,\nUncannily resembled him, appearing\nImmortal in a finitude of mirrors.\n\nBut when the sudden force of the disease\nTossed him, in a new garment, on the bed\nWhere he had wakened, mornings, as a child--\nDespised by all the neighbors, helpless, blind\nAnd vulnerable to every life, he listened\nIntensely to the roosters, mules and cows\nAs well as to the voices of the desk,\nThe chair, the books and pictures, pastures and fields,\nThe tree of every season, the age of seas\nAnd, on its surge, the age of galaxies,\nThe bells within the spires of Cambridge, bodies\nAnd faces revealed or hidden in the flow,\nAll that we knew or could imagine joined\nTogether in the sound the stream flows through\nAs witness of itself in every change,\nEach trusting in its continuities,\nAll turning in a final radiant shell.\nThen, on his darkened eye, he saw himself\nA compact disk awhirl, played by the light\nHe came from and was ready to reenter,\nBut not before he chose the way to go.\nAnd so it was, before his death, he spoke\nThe poem that is his best, the final letter\nTo take to that old country as a passport.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "In Memory of Sigmund Freud", "view_node": "/poem/memory-sigmund-freud", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/w-h-auden\" hreflang=\"und\">W.

Too tired to care\nabout anything, not their business dealing,\n\nnot the drunken nostalgia for a whore\nknown during the war--he can't remember\n\nher name, or the place where she worked, the \nstreet\nit was on, but could I help him find her?\n\nHe's never forgotten . . . I grew so tired\nof phones ringing for eight hours straight.\n\nI wanted to pull my hair out, one thin\nstrand at a time. It was a newly\n\ninvented circle of hell, and if you\nhad been there, you just might understand\n\nwhy that infamous <i>hippie girl</i> rose up,\nout of her chair, yanked the earphones off, and \nclimbed\n\nonto a counter running the length of the room\nbeneath our long, black switchboard, then, \ncrawling\n\nfrom station to station, pulled each cord\nfrom its black tunnel, breaking one connection\n\nafter another, like a series of\n<i>coitus interruptus</i> all down the board,\n\nbefore they stopped her, and led her away.\n<i>She must be on LSD</i>, said a wife\n\nfrom the Alameda military base. <i>And she wears\nno underwear, either</i>, added another.\n\nThat was 1970, back when Oakland\nOverseas was still manual, but the hatred\n\nof a ringing phone is with me yet.\nI will stand at the center of a room\n\nand watch the damn thing ring its little head \noff,\nand I will grin, quite stupidly, at its\n\nhelplessness. I will walk out the door, fill\nmy lungs with ice, head for the far-off peaks.\n\nI will lose myself, become one small, dark \nstroke\nin the white stillness of snow. I'm telling you\n\nnow, it was a brand new circle of hell,\nbut how could we know that, then? We had jobs,\n\nthe market was tight, and the union\nwon us cab rides home when we worked at night.\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Nothing Ventured", "view_node": "/poem/nothing-ventured", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/kay-ryan\" hreflang=\"und\">Kay Ryan</a>", "field_date_published": "2000", "body": " <pre>\nNothing exists as a block\nand cannot be parceled up.\nSo if nothing's ventured\nit's not just talk;\nit's the big wager.\nDon't you wonder\nhow people think\nthe banks of space \nand time don't matter?\nHow they'll drain\nthe big tanks down to \nslime and salamanders\nand want thanks?\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Work", "view_node": "/poem/work", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/emma-lazarus\" hreflang=\"und\">Emma Lazarus</a>", "field_date_published": "1871", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Yet life is not a vision nor a prayer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 But stubborn work; she may not shun her task.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After the first compassion, none will spare</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Her portion and her work achieved, to ask.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She pleads for respite,\u2014she will come ere long</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When, resting by the roadside, she is strong.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Nay, for the hurrying throng of passers-by</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Will crush her with their onward-rolling stream.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Much must be done before the brief light die;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 She may not loiter, rapt in the vain dream.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With unused trembling hands, and faltering feet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She staggers forth, her lot assigned to meet.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But when she fills her days with duties done,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Strange vigor comes, she is restored to health.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">New aims, new interests rise with each new sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And life still holds for her unbounded wealth.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All that seemed hard and toilsome now proves small,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And naught may daunt her,\u2014she hath strength for all.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "The Idea of Ancestry", "view_node": "/poem/idea-ancestry", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/etheridge-knight\" hreflang=\"und\">Etheridge Knight</a>", "field_date_published": "1986", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">1</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Taped to the wall of my cell are 47 pictures: 47 black</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">faces: my father, mother, grandmothers (1 dead), grand-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">fathers (both dead), brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">cousins (1st and 2nd), nieces, and nephews.
