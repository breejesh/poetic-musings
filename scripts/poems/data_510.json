The natural bond\nOf brotherhood is severed as the flax\nThat falls asunder at the touch of fire.\nHe finds his fellow guilty of a skin\nNot coloured like his own, and having power\nTo enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause\nDooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.\nLands intersected by a narrow frith\nAbhor each other. Mountains interposed\nMake enemies of nations, who had else\nLike kindred drops been mingled into one.\nThus man devotes his brother, and destroys;\nAnd worse than all, and most to be deplored,\nAs human nature's broadest, foulest blot,\nChains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat\nWith stripes, that mercy, with a bleeding heart,\nWeeps when she sees inflicted on a beast.\nThen what is man? And what man, seeing this,\nAnd having human feelings, does not blush\nAnd hang his head, to think himself a man?\nI would not have a slave to till my ground,\nTo carry me, to fan me while I sleep,\nAnd tremble when I wake, for all the wealth\nThat sinews bought and sold have ever earned.\nNo: dear as freedom is, and in my heart's\nJust estimation prized above all price,\nI had much rather be myself the slave\nAnd wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.\nWe have no slaves at home\u2014then why abroad?\nAnd they themselves, once ferried o'er the wave\nThat parts us, are emancipate and loosed.\nSlaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\nReceive our air, that moment they are free,\nThey touch our country and their shackles fall.\nThat's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud\nAnd jealous of the blessing. Spread it then,\nAnd let it circulate through every vein\nOf all your empire; that where Britain's power\nIs felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Olney Hymns, XLVIII [Joy and Peace in Believing]", "view_node": "/poem/olney-hymns-xlviii-joy-and-peace-believing", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-cowper\" hreflang=\"und\">William Cowper</a>", "field_date_published": "1779", "body": " <pre>\nSometimes a light surprises\n     The Christian while he sings;\nIt is the Lord who rises\n     With healing on His wings;\nWhen comforts are declining,\n     He grants the soul again\nA season of clear shining,\n     To cheer it after rain.\n\nIn holy contemplation\n     We sweetly then pursue\nThe theme of God's salvation,\n     And find it ever new;\nSet free from present sorrow,\n     We cheerfully can say,\nE'en let the unknown to-morrow\n     Bring with it what it may!\n\nIt can bring with it nothing,\n     But He will bear us through;\nWho gives the lilies clothing,\n     Will clothe His people too;\nBeneath the spreading heavens\n     No creature but is fed;\nAnd He who feeds the ravens\n     Will give His children bread.\n\nThough vine nor fig tree neither\n     Their wonted fruit shall bear,\nThough all the field should wither,\n     Nor flocks nor herds be there:\nYet God the same abiding,\n     His praise shall tune my voice;\nFor, while in Him confiding,\n     I cannot but rejoice.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Olney Hymns, I, [Walking with God]", "view_node": "/poem/olney-hymns-i-walking-god", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-cowper\" hreflang=\"und\">William Cowper</a>", "field_date_published": "1779", "body": " <pre>\nOh! for a closer walk with God,\n     A calm and heavenly frame; \nA light to shine upon the road\n     That leads me to the Lamb!\n\nWhere is the blessedness I knew\n     When first I saw the Lord? \nWhere is the soul-refreshing view\n     Of Jesus and his word?\n\nWhat peaceful hours I once enjoyed!\n     How sweet their memory still! \nBut they have left an aching void,\n     The world can never fill.\n\nReturn, O holy Dove, return!\n     Sweet the messenger of rest! \nI hate the sins that made thee mourn\n     And drove thee from my breast.\n\nThe dearest idol I have known,\n     Whate'er that idol be, \nHelp me to tear it from thy throne,\n     And worship only thee.\n\nSo shall my walk be close with God,\n     Calm and serene my frame; \nSo purer light shall mark the road\n     That leads me to the Lamb.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Olney Hymns, XXXII [The Shining Light]", "view_node": "/poem/olney-hymns-xxxii-shining-light", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-cowper\" hreflang=\"und\">William Cowper</a>", "field_date_published": "1779", "body": " <pre>\nMy former hopes are fled,\n     My terror now begins; \nI feel, alas! that I am dead\n     In trespasses and sins.\n\nAh, whither shall I fly?\n     I hear the thunder roar; \nThe Law proclaims Destruction nigh,\n     And Vengeance at the door.\n\nWhen I review my ways,\n     I dread impending doom: \nBut sure a friendly whisper says,\n     \"Flee from the wrath to come.\"\n\nI see, or think I see,\n     A glimm'ring from afar; \nA beam of day, that shines for me,\n     To save me from despair.\n\nFore-runner of the sun,\n     It marks the pilgrim's way; \nI'll gaze upon it while I run,\n     And watch the rising day.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Olney Hymns, IX [The Contrite Heart]", "view_node": "/poem/olney-hymns-ix-contrite-heart", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-cowper\" hreflang=\"und\">William Cowper</a>", "field_date_published": "1779", "body": " <pre>\nThe Lord will happiness divine\n     On contrite hearts bestow; \nThen tell me, gracious God, is mine\n     A contrite heart or no?\n\nI hear, but seem to hear in vain,\n     Insensible as steel; \nIf aught is felt, 'tis only pain,\n     To find I cannot feel.\n\nI sometimes think myself inclined\n     To love Thee if I could; \nBut often feel another mind,\n     Averse to all that's good.\n\nMy best desires are faint and few,\n     I fain would strive for more; \nBut when I cry, \"My strength renew!\"\n     Seem weaker than before.\n\nThy saints are comforted, I know,\n     And love Thy house of prayer; \nI therefore go where others go,\n     But find no comfort there.\n\nOh make this heart rejoice or ache;\n     Decide this doubt for me; \nAnd if it be not broken, break\u2014\n     And heal it, if it be.</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 510, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
