class=\"long-line\">The wrangling tongues of Western men,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each, crossed at arms with his compeer.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In that fair land, where passions rage</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Briefly, through Nature\u2019s gentleness;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where the black eyebrows\u2019 direst forwn,</span><br

sighed: \u2018Hush! hush! my countrymen\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Let this untempered babbling cease!</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u2018Ye who assert your rights in

class=\"long-line\">Without the color of his face.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u2018Reluctantly they bared the sword,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And let the prudent scabbard
