class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was bold Kentucky\u2019s grit, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the old Virginian valor. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the daring Yankee wit. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There were blue eyes from turfy Shannon, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were black orbs from palmy Niger \u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But there, alongside the cannon. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each man fought like a tiger! </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A little, once, it looked ill. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our consort began to burn\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They quenched the flames with a will. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But our

class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So fiercely their broadsides blazed, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The regiments fighting ashore </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgot to fire as they gazed. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There, to silence the Foe, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moving grimly and slow, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They loomed in that deadly wreath, </span><br /><span

class=\"long-line\">And the black torpedoes beneath! </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And now, as we looked ahead. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All for\u2019ard, the long white deck </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was growing a strange dull red ; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But
