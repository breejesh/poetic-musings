Caves. Closings. Relentlessly the body leaves the bed. Does things. A day is merry and eager for prosperity. It dings dings the bell in its own head. The ritual of masking the breasts in heavy fabric, of covering the legs and feet. A face from the mirror says, I am pretty, I am pretty. Skin of opening, meant for opening. A sex in training. Trimmed, fastidious. Damp reasoning. Yet, adherence. Mask the breasts. Mark the skin. <i>You are not from here, are you?</i> Part tissue. <i>What does it feel like?</i> It feels like everything else. <i>It must be different from some other thing.</i> No. This is what a woman's body is.

At times\nthe king was a despot; at other times,\nnot. Axes flashed in the road\n\nat night, but if you closed your eyes\nsitting on the well-edge\namongst your kinspeople\nand sang the ballads\nthen the silver did not appear\nto be broken.  \n\nSuch were the circumstances.\nThey made a liar out of me. \nDid they change my spirit? \nKith in the night. \nThe cry of owls. A bird fight.\n\n\nII. \n\nWe also had a queen,\nwhetted by the moon. And\nwe her subjects,\nsoftening in her sight.\n\n\nIII.\n\nWhat one had \nthe other had to\nhave too. Soon \nparrots bloomed\nin every garden, and \nevery daughter\nhad a tuning fork \njeweled with emeralds.\n\n\nIV.\n\nLearning to hunt in the new empire,\nthe king invited his subjects\nto send him their knives.\nHe tested these knives on oranges,\npomegranates, acorn squash,\nsoft birches, stillborns, prisoners\nwho had broken rules. He used\nthem on the teeth of traitors.\n\n\nV.\n\nWhen strangers massed at the border,\nthe courtiers practiced \nsubjection of the foreign. The court \nheld a procession \nof twine, rope,\ngold, knives, and\nprostitutes with their vials of white\npowder. Smoke coursed into the courtyard,\nand we wrought hunger upon\nthe bodies of strangers. I am sure you\ncan imagine\nit, really what need \nis there for me to tell you.\nYou were a stranger once too, and I\nbrought rope.\n\n\nVI.\n\nAfterward, I \nslept,\nand let the dealers \ncome to me alone \nwith their jewels and \ntheir powders.\n\n\nVII.\n\nAt night, we debated\nthe skin of language,\nquestioned what might\nbe revealed inside:\na soft pink fruit,\na woman in a field\u2026\nOr a shadow, sticky and loose\nas old jam. Our own \ndialect was abstract,\nwe wished to understand\nnot how things were\nbut what spectacle we might \nmake from them.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nOne day a merchant came to court \nand brought moving pictures, \nthe emperor\u2019s new delight. \nHe tacked dark cloth \nto the windows and turned off\nthe lights, cranking the machine and the film\nlike a needle and thread,\nmaking stories we could \ninsinuate our cold bodies\ninto and find warmth. Light;\ndark. And the sliding images of courtiers\nmerrily balancing monkeys\non their heads, as if this \nwere an adequate story.\n\n\nIX.\n\nAnd our queen, that hidden\nself. What became\nof her? Slid into the night\nlike a statue, shivered\ninto shadows. Knowing as a spider\nin retreat. The web\nher mind, and in it, the fly.\n\n\nX.\n\nOn Sundays, we flew kites \nto ensure our joy\nwas seen by those who \nthreatened\nto threaten us. The thread\nspooling out high \nin the purple sky\nand silver-gelatin films being made,\nsliding through the cranking machine\nso that the barbarians could know\nwe made images of ourselves\ncoated in precious metal\nand sent them away\nindifferent to our wealth.\n\nI miss the citrus \nsmell of spring\non the plaza filled\nwith young\nand long-limbed kite flyers.\n\n\nXI.\n\nDo I have anything \nto add? Only that\nI obeyed my king, my\nkind, I was not faithless.\nShould I be punished\nfor that? It is true \nthe pictures creaking \nthrough the spindle\ncause me pain. I know \nthe powder we coated our fingers\nwith made us thirsty\nand sometimes cruel. But I was born\nwith a spirit, like you.\nI have woken, you see,\nand I wish to be made new.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Ophelia to the Court", "view_node": "/poem/ophelia-court", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/meghan-orourke\" hreflang=\"und\">Meghan O&#039;Rourke</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>\nMy shoes are unpolished, my words smudged.\nI come to you undressed (the lord, he whispers\nSmut; that man, he whispers such).
