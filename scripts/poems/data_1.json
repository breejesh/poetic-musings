The rest</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They thought, \"If only Casey could but get a whack at that\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Blake, the much despis\u00e8d, tore the cover off the ball;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"That ain't my style,\" said Casey. \"Strike one!\" the umpire said.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Kill him! Kill the umpire!\" shouted someone on the stand;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, \"Strike two!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\"Fraud!\" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered \"Fraud!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But there is no joy in
