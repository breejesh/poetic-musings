Resist the taste for something still \nalive for your first meal; resist the craving \nfor the touch of a hand from your past. \nWe live some memories,\nand some memories are planted. There's\nonly so much space for the truth\nand the fabrications to spread out \nin one's mind. When there's no more \nspace, we grow desperate. You'll ask \nif practicing love for years in your mind, \nprepares you for the moment,\nif practicing to defend one's life\nis the same as living? You'll\nhole up, captive, in a hotel room\nfor fifteen years and learn to find\na man within you, which will prove \na painful introduction to the trance\ninto which you were born. Better\nto stay under the spell of your guilt,\nthan to forget; you've already released\nyour pain onto the world; don't believe\nthere's some joy in forgetting. \nThere's no joy in the struggle to forget. \nAnd what appears as an endless verdant field, \nonly spreads across a building's rooftop;\nyour peaceful sleep could be a fetal position,\nwhich secures you in a suitcase in this field. \nA bell rings, and you fall out of this luggage \nlike clothes you no longer fit. Now what to do?\nYou remember when you were the man\nwho fit those clothes, but you've forgotten this \nworld. Even forgotten scenes from your life, \nleave shadows of the memory,\nhaunting your spirit \nuntil, within a moment's glance,\nstrangers passing you on the street,\nobserve history in your eyes. Experience\nlingers through acts of forgetting, \nsmall acts of love or trauma \nfalling from the same place. Whether\nmemory comes in the form of a stone\nor a grain of sand, they both sink in water.\nA tongue\u2014even if it were, say, sworn \nto secrecy; or if it were cut from one's mouth;\nyes, even without a mouth to envelop \nits truth\u2014the tongue continues to confess.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Anatomy", "view_node": "/poem/anatomy", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/monica-ferrell\" hreflang=\"und\">Monica Ferrell</a>", "field_date_published": "2012", "body": " <pre>\nMan shaped out of mud\nAnd made to speak and love\u2014\nLet's stick in him a little whisperer,\n\nA bucket with two holes.\nLet's give him the Great Deceiver,\nA blood-stone.\n\nA church with a vaulted ceiling\nWhere the White and Blue Niles meet.\nA dog who cries after dark.\n\nEveryone has a heart,\nEven the people who don't.\nIt floats up like a beached whale in the autopsy.\n\nThe heart has no sense of humor.\nIt offers itself piteously like a pair of handcuffs,\nAnd is so clumsy that we turn away.\n\nThe past \nIs a quarryful of marble statues\nWith heads and genitals erased,\n\nBut the heart is a muscle made of sharkbone and mutters,\nResting place softened with hay\nWhere all the cows come home, finally.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "It is a Beauteous Evening, Calm and Free", "view_node": "/poem/it-beauteous-evening-calm-and-free", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-wordsworth\" hreflang=\"und\">William Wordsworth</a>", "field_date_published": "1807", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The holy time is quiet as a Nun</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Breathless with adoration; the broad sun</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is sinking down in its tranquility;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Listen! the mighty Being is awake,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And doth with his eternal motion make</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A sound like thunder\u2014everlastingly.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thy nature is not therefore less divine:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner shrine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">God being with thee when we know it not.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Poem Dedicated to Spatola", "view_node": "/poem/poem-dedicated-spatola", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/amelia-rosselli\" hreflang=\"und\">Amelia Rosselli</a>", "field_date_published": "2012", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">The sea has white points that I don't know and tempo, so good</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">it wags good in my embrace, I corrupt sweetly\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and slight it laments the aches at the knee touched to me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Without spite I remind you of an immense day of joy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but you forget true knowledge.
