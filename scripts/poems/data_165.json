The boy runs out to the water then disappears. There are certain words to describe certain waves. Fugitive. Objects are not fugitive, the waves carrying them are. I\u2019ve flown over the Pacific Ocean once\u2014when my family moved to California when I was six. I\u2019ve had my cards read, also only once, with the CHARIOT card blocking one thing from another. It was many years ago and I was maybe drunk and worse, the boy reading me the cards was someone who I was so stupidly in love with that my brain broke when we were together. I was all heart. He pointed his finger to the CHARIOT card and said something about how there must be something locked with the migration when I was six, something that still needed unlocking. He was right. He married and divorced his then-girlfriend and how he has two kids. She lives in one state, he lives in another. Some of that is still true.

I've learned that writing poems is possible and possibility diminishes exploration. When I arrive elsewhere, say, to the essay, I feel at play. I feel like I have come upon new toys with no instructions. I wander. I hold at an idea longer. I think freer. I don\u2019t look for the exit door as quickly as I would in a poem. It lets me explore the wildness that I initially found so exciting in poetry. <em>So, in that sense, our trajectories are similar, just going in opposite directions. Exhausted, the essay brought me to poetry. And for you, exhausted, poems are bringing you to the essay.</em> Then, there\u2019s the artless essay, the dreaded personal statement. The last one read: I intend to contribute to the seldom-told narrative of living as an undocumented Filipino-American whose path to citizenship is tied up with another politicized modern moment: the legalization of gay marriage. As a corporeal intersection of both undocumented and queer identities, my body is seen by many as unnatural\u2014a site of horror, a target of the phobic. As such, two major threats loom over the project: the risk of sexually transmitted diseases on the gay male body and deportation for the undocumented non-citizen. For many who share my unique position, the desire for state-sanctioned citizenship is analogous to the cure for HIV, two statuses that are, for now, locked in utopian vision\u2014objects on the horizon.\u00a0</p> "}, {"title": "Hindi Ko Alam Ng Sasabihin Ko", "view_node": "/poem/hindi-ko-alam-ng-sasabihin-ko", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jan-henry-gray\" hreflang=\"en\">Jan-Henry Gray</a>", "field_date_published": "2019", "body": " <p>your mother shops for a fish<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a plastic bag for a glove<br />you untangle the wires with the crew<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a boy among men<br />you choose the photograph for the wake<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a finger in your mouth<br />you tied the string too tight<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0you were poor but happy<br />you didn't know what to say<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0a balloon's string strung on your wrist<br />you watch your mother in the blue-black kitchen<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0men sag to touch the dancing boys<br />in the hospital full of Filipina nurses<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0dry palm trees rustle in the Santa Ana winds<br />she grips her ankle on the floor<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0you ask what to say and how to say it<br />she takes her wig off and lights a candle<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0to clear the spirits from the room</p> "}, {"title": "Maid Poem #7: HR", "view_node": "/poem/maid-poem-7-hr", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jan-henry-gray\" hreflang=\"en\">Jan-Henry Gray</a>", "field_date_published": "2016", "body": " <p>At the Maid Museum we honor the many who have cooked meals in other people\u2019s kitchens, washed floors, labored on holidays, nursed the frail, and tended the children. The Maid Museum houses art commemorating Maid Culture by the best artists of our time. On exhibit are wall-sized paintings, large-scale photography, sculpture and installation. Artifacts, letters, and other ephemera are preserved and on display in the temperature-controlled galleries. Our docents are robust, learned, but unrobotic. They have mastered the pronunciations of all of the Maids\u2019 names. Doing so is required research and research is synonymous with interest which we value here. The Museum is free. We are open 24 hours to accommodate the many faiths and habits in our community. The coffee is good and strong and you will agree. Tea is served on every floor. Lunch too is good. There are complimentary house-made pickles and free refills. All of our employees have health insurance so that getting sick is not also shameful. Uniforms are provided. There is ride-share, snow days, sick days, paid vacation, direct deposit, and a generous R&amp;D budget. On payday at The Maid, every employee receives a brown envelope with a handwritten letter by one of the poets-in-residence thanking them for their service. Each note describes \u201cOne Thing Done Well\u201d during that pay cycle. The envelope may also include an image of you documenting that moment; images culled from the surveillance footage.
