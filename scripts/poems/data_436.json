Behind them followed the watch-dog,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Patient, full of importance, and grand in the pride of his instinct,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Walking from side to side with a lordly air, and superbly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waving his bushy tail, and urging forward the stragglers;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept; their protector,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When from the forest at night, through the starry silence, the wolves howled.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Late, with the rising moon, returned the wains from the marshes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laden with briny hay, that filled the air with its odor.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cheerily neighed the steeds, with dew on their manes and their fetlocks,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Painted with brilliant dyes, and adorned with tassels of crimson,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nodded in bright array, like hollyhocks heavy with blossoms.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Patiently stood the cows meanwhile, and yielded their udders</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unto the milkmaid's hand; whilst loud and in regular cadence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the sounding pails the foaming streamlets descended.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farm-yard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Echoed back by the barns. Anon they sank into stillness;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Heavily closed, with a jarring sound, the valves of the barn-doors,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rattled the wooden bars, and all for a season was silent.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In-doors, warm by the wide-mouthed fireplace, idly the farmer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sat in his elbow-chair, and watched how the flames and the smoke-wreaths</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Struggled together like foes in a burning city. Behind him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nodding and mocking along the wall, with gestures fantastic,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Darted his own huge shadow, and vanished away into darkness.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Faces, clumsily carved in oak, on the back of his arm-chair</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laughed in the flickering light, and the pewter plates on the dresser</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Caught and reflected the flame, as shields of armies the sunshine.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fragments of song the old man sang, and carols of Christmas,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such as at home, in the olden time, his fathers before him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sang in their Norman orchards and bright Burgundian vineyards.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close at her father's side was the gentle Evangeline seated,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Spinning flax for the loom, that stood in the corner behind her.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent awhile were its treadles, at rest was its diligent shuttle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While the monotonous drone of the wheel, like the drone of a bagpipe,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Followed the old man's songs and united the fragments together.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As in a church, when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Footfalls are heard in the aisles, or words of the priest at the altar,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So, in each pause of the song, with measured motion the clock clicked.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus as they sat, there were footsteps heard, and, suddenly lifted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sounded the wooden latch, and the door swung back on its hinges.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Benedict knew by the hob-nailed shoes it was Basil the blacksmith,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And by her beating heart Evangeline knew who was with him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Welcome!\" the farmer exclaimed, as their footsteps paused on the threshold.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Welcome, Basil, my friend! Come, take thy place on the settle</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close by the chimney-side, which is always empty without thee;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, with a smile of content, thus answered Basil the blacksmith,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Benedict Bellefontaine, thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ever in cheerfullest mood art thou, when others are filled with</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gloomy forebodings of ill, and see only ruin before them.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Happy art thou, as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pausing a moment, to take the pipe that Evangeline brought him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with a coal from the embers had lighted, he slowly continued:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Four days now are passed since the English ships at their anchors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ride in the Gaspereau's mouth, with their cannon pointed against us.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What their design may be is unknown; but all are commanded</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the morrow to meet in the church, where his Majesty's mandate</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Will be proclaimed as law in the land. Alas! in the mean time</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then made answer the farmer:\u2014\"Perhaps some friendlier purpose</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Brings these ships to our shores. Perhaps the harvests in England</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Not so thinketh the folk in the village,\" said, warmly, the blacksmith,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shaking his head, as in doubt; then, heaving a sigh, he continued:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Louisburg is not forgotten, nor Beau Sejour, nor Port Royal.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Many already have fled to the forest, and lurk on its outskirts,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to-morrow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Arms have been taken from us, and warlike weapons of all kinds;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nothing is left but the blacksmith's sledge and the scythe of the mower.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Safer are we unarmed, in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Safer within these peaceful dikes, besieged by the ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Than our fathers in forts, besieged by the enemy's cannon.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fear no evil, my friend, and to-night may no shadow of sorrow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fall on this house and hearth; for this is the night of the contract.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Built are the house and the barn. The merry lads of the village</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strongly have built them and well; and, breaking the glebe round about them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled the barn with hay, and the house with food for a twelvemonth.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rene Leblanc will be here anon, with his papers and inkhorn.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shall we not then be glad, and rejoice in the joy of our children?\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As apart by the window she stood, with her hand in her lover's,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Blushing Evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as they died on his lips, the worthy notary entered.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><span class=\"long-line\">Canto III</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Bent like a laboring oar, that toils in the surf of the ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bent, but not broken, by age was the form of the notary public;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shocks of yellow hair, like the silken floss of the maize, hung</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over his shoulders; his forehead was high; and glasses with horn bows</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sat astride on his nose, with a look of wisdom supernal.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Father of twenty children was he, and more than a hundred</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Children's children rode on his knee, and heard his great watch tick.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suffering much in an old French fort as the friend of the English.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now, though warier grown, without all guile or suspicion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ripe in wisdom was he, but patient, and simple, and childlike.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He was beloved by all, and most of all by the children;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For he told them tales of the Loup-garou in the forest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And of the white Letiche, the ghost of a child who unchristened</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Died, and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And how on Christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And of the marvellous powers of four-leaved clover and horseshoes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then up rose from his seat by the fireside Basil the blacksmith,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knocked from his pipe the ashes, and slowly extending his right hand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Father Leblanc,\" he exclaimed, \"thou hast heard the talk in the village,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, perchance, canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Gossip enough have I heard, in sooth, yet am never the wiser;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And what their errand may be I know not better than others.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet am I not of those who imagine some evil intention</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Brings them here, for we are at peace; and why then molest us?\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"God's name!\" shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Must we in all things look for the how, and the why, and the wherefore?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Daily injustice is done, and might is the right of the strongest!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But, without heeding his warmth, continued the notary public,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Man is unjust, but God is just; and finally justice</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Triumphs; and well I remember a story, that often consoled me,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When as a captive I lay in the old French fort at Port Royal.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This was the old man's favorite tale, and he loved to repeat it</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Once in an ancient city, whose name I no longer remember,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Raised aloft on a column, a brazen statue of Justice</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stood in the public square, upholding the scales in its left hand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in its right a sword, as an emblem that justice presided</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over the laws of the land, and the hearts and homes of the people.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Might took the place of right, and the weak were oppressed, and the mighty</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ruled with an iron rod. Then it chanced in a nobleman's palace</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That a necklace of pearls was lost, and erelong a suspicion</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She, after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of Justice.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As to her Father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lo! o'er the city a tempest rose; and the bolts of the thunder</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Smote the statue of bronze, and hurled in wrath from its left hand</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into whose clay-built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silenced, but not convinced, when the story was ended, the blacksmith</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stood like a man who fain would speak, but findeth no language;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face, as the vapors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Freeze in fantastic shapes on the window-panes in the winter.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then Evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled, till it overflowed, the pewter tankard with home-brewed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nut-brown ale, that was famed for its strength in the village of Grand-Pr\u00e9;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Orderly all things proceeded, and duly and well were completed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Three times the old man's fee in solid pieces of silver;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the notary rising, and blessing the bride and the bridegroom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wiping the foam from his lip, he solemnly bowed and departed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till Evangeline brought the draught-board out of its corner.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon was the game begun. In friendly contention the old men</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laughed at each lucky hit, or unsuccessful manoeuver,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laughed when a man was crowned, or a breach was made in the king-row</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile apart, in the twilight gloom of a window's embrasure,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sat the lovers, and whispered together, beholding the moon rise</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Blossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus was the evening passed. Anon the bell from the belfry</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rang out the hour of nine, the village curfew, and straightway</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose the guests and departed; and silence reigned in the household.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Many a farewell word and sweet good-night on the door-step</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lingered long in Evangeline's heart, and filled it with gladness.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth-stone,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon with a soundless step the foot of Evangeline followed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent she passed the hall, and entered the door of her chamber.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Simple that chamber was, with its curtains of white, and its clothes-press</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ample and high, on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Linen and woollen stuffs, by the hand of Evangeline woven.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Better than flocks and herds, being proofs of her skill as a housewife.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon she extinguished her lamp, for the mellow and radiant moonlight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Streamed through the windows, and lighted the room, till the heart of the maiden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swelled and obeyed its power, like the tremulous tides of the ocean.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ah! she was fair, exceeding fair to behold, as she stood with</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Naked snow-white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Little she dreamed that below, among the trees of the orchard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet were her thoughts of him, and at times a feeling of sadness</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Passed o'er her soul, as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as she gazed from the window, she saw serenely the moon pass</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Forth from the folds of a cloud, and one star follow her footsteps,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As out of Abraham's tent young Ishmael wandered with Hagar!</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><span class=\"long-line\">Canto IV</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of Grand-Pr\u00e9.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pleasantly gleamed in the soft, sweet air the Basin of Minas,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the ships, with their wavering shadows, were riding at anchor.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Life had long been astir in the village, and clamorous labor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now from the country around, from the farms and neighboring hamlets,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came in their holiday dresses the blithe Acadian peasants.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Many a glad good-morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Made the bright air brighter, as up from the numerous meadows,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Group after group appeared, and joined, or passed on the highway.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long ere noon, in the village all sounds of labor were silenced.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thronged were the streets with people;

And lo! with a summons sonorous</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drum beat.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thronged erelong was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Garlands of autumn-leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Entered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Echoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Closed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then uprose their commander, and spoke from the steps of the altar,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Holding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"You are convened this day,\" he said, \"by his Majesty's orders.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Let your own hearts reply!

God grant you may dwell there</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ever as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Prisoners now I declare you; for such is his Majesty's pleasure!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beats down the farmer's corn in the field and shatters his windows,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house-roofs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their enclosures;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the door-way.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Vain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rang through the house of prayer; and high o'er the heads of the others</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Death to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">More he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Raising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Deep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Spake he, as, after the tocsin's alarum, distinctly the clock strikes.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Forty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lo! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">See! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, 'O Father, forgive them!'</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Let us repeat it now, and say, 'O Father, forgive them!'\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Few were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While they repeated his prayer, and said, \"O Father, forgive them!\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then came the evening service. The tapers gleamed from the altar.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not with their lips alone, but their hearts; and the Ave Maria</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sang they, and fell on their knees, and their souls, with devotion translated,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose on the ardor of prayer, like Elijah ascending to heaven.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill, and on all sides</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wandered, wailing, from house to house the women and children.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long at her father's door Evangeline stood, with her right hand</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun, that, descending,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lighted the village street with mysterious splendor, and roofed each</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Peasant's cottage with golden thatch, and emblazoned its windows.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long within had been spread the snow-white cloth on the table;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There stood the wheaten loaf, and the honey fragrant with wild-flowers;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There stood the tankard of ale, and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, at the head of the board, the great arm-chair of the farmer.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus did Evangeline wait at her father's door, as the sunset</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Threw the long shadows of trees o'er the broad ambrosial meadows.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ah! on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Charity, meekness, love, and hope, and forgiveness, and patience!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, all-forgetful of self, she wandered into the village,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As o'er the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Urged by their household cares, and the weary feet of their children.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down sank the great red sun, and in golden, glimmering vapors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Veiled the light of his face, like the Prophet descending from Sinai.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sweetly over the village the bell of the Angelus sounded.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile, amid the gloom, by the church Evangeline lingered.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All was silent within; and in vain at the door and the windows</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stood she, and listened and looked, till, overcome by emotion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Gabriel!\" cried she aloud with tremulous voice; but no answer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came from the graves of the dead, nor the gloomier grave of the living.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Smouldered the fire on the hearth, on the board was the supper untasted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Empty and drear was each room, and haunted with phantoms of terror.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore-tree by the window.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Keenly the lightning flashed; and the voice of the echoing thunder</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Told her that God was in heaven, and governed the world he created!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of Heaven;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soothed was her troubled soul, and she peacefully slumbered till morning.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><span class=\"long-line\">Canto V</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Four times the sun had risen and set; and now on the fifth day</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farm-house.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon o'er the yellow fields, in silent and mournful procession,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the Acadian women,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea-shore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close at their sides their children ran, and urged on the oxen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth they hurried; and there on the sea-beach</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All day long the wains came laboring down from the village.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Late in the afternoon, when the sun was near to his setting,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Echoed far o'er the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thither the women and children thronged. On a sudden the church-doors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Opened, and forth came the guard, and marching in gloomy procession</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Followed the long-imprisoned, but patient, Acadian farmers.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Even as pilgrims, who journey afar from their homes and their country,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sing as they go, and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So with songs on their lips the Acadian peasants descended</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down from the church to the shore, amid their wives and their daughters.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Foremost the young men came; and, raising together their voices,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sang with tremulous lips a chant of the Catholic Missions:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Sacred heart of the Saviour! O inexhaustible fountain!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then the old men, as they marched, and the women that stood by the wayside</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Joined in the sacred psalm, and the birds in the sunshine above them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mingled their notes therewith, like voices of spirits departed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Half-way down to the shore Evangeline waited in silence,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not overcome with grief, but strong in the hour of affliction,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Calmly and sadly she waited, until the procession approached her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And she beheld the face of Gabriel pale with emotion.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tears then filled her eyes, and, eagerly running to meet him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clasped she his hands, and laid her head on his shoulder, and whispered,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Gabriel! be of good cheer! for if we love one another</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nothing, in truth, can harm us, whatever mischances may happen!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Smiling she spake these words; then suddenly paused, for her father</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saw she slowly advancing. Alas! how changed was his aspect!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gone was the glow from his cheek, and the fire from his eye, and his footstep</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But with a smile and a sigh, she clasped his neck and embraced him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus to the Gaspereau's mouth moved on that mournful procession.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There disorder prevailed, and the tumult and stir of embarking.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Busily plied the freighted boats; and in the confusion</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wives were torn from their husbands, and mothers, too late, saw their children</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Left on the land, extending their arms, with wildest entreaties.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So unto separate ships were Basil and Gabriel carried,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While in despair on the shore Evangeline stood with her father.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Half the task was not done when the sun went down, and the twilight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Deepened and darkened around; and in haste the refluent ocean</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fled away from the shore, and left the line of the sand-beach</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Covered with waifs of the tide, with kelp and the slippery sea-weed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like to a gypsy camp, or a leaguer after a battle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All escape cut off by the sea, and the sentinels near them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lay encamped for the night the houseless Acadian farmers.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles, and leaving</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, as the night descended, the herds returned from their pastures;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lowing they waited, and long, at the well-known bars of the farm-yard,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silence reigned in the streets; from the church no Angelus sounded,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose no smoke from the roofs, and gleamed no lights from the windows.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Built of the drift-wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Voices of women were heard, and of men, and the crying of children.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Onward from fire to fire, as from hearth to hearth in his parish,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wandered the faithful priest, consoling and blessing and cheering,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like unto shipwrecked Paul on Melita's desolate sea-shore.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus he approached the place where Evangeline sat with her father,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Haggard and hollow and wan, and without either thought or emotion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">E'en as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Vainly Evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Vainly offered him food; yet he moved not, he looked not, he spake not</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But, with a vacant stare, ever gazed at the flickering fire-light.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Benedicite!\" murmured the priest, in tones of compassion.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">More he fain would have said, but his heart was full, and his accents</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Faltered and paused on his lips, as the feet of a child on a threshold,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silently, therefore, he laid his hand on the head of the maiden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly rose from the south a light, as in autumn the blood-red</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven, and o'er the horizon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Titan-like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Columns of shining smoke uprose, and flashes of flame were</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch, and, uplifting,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whirled them aloft through the air, at once from a hundred house-tops</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speechless at first they stood, then cried aloud in their anguish,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"We shall behold no more our homes in the village of Grand-Pr\u00e9!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm-yards,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thinking the day had dawned; and anon the lowing of cattle</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of dogs interrupted.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then rose a sound of dread, such as startles the sleeping encampments</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the Nebraska,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such was the sound that arose on the night, as the herds and the horses</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Broke through their folds and fences, and madly rushed o'er the meadows.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Overwhelmed with the sight, yet speechless, the priest and the maiden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lo! from his seat he had fallen, and stretched abroad on the sea-shore</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head, and the maiden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knelt at her father's side, and wailed aloud in her terror.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then in a swoon she sank, and lay with her head on his bosom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through the long night she lay in deep, oblivious slumber;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And when she woke from the trance, she beheld a multitude near her.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Faces of friends she beheld, that were mournfully gazing upon her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pallid, with tearful eyes, and looks of saddest compassion.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Reddened the sky overhead, and gleamed on the faces around her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then a familiar voice she heard, as it said to the people,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Let us bury him here by the sea. When a happier season</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such were the words of the priest. And there in haste by the sea-side,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But without bell or book, they buried the farmer of Grand-Pr\u00e9.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lo! with a mournful sound, like the voice of a vast congregation,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Solemnly answered the sea, and mingled its roar with the dirges.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'T was the returning tide, that afar from the waste of the ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With the first dawn of the day, came heaving and hurrying landward.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and the village in ruins.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Part the Second</strong></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><span class=\"long-line\">Canto I</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Many a weary year had passed since the burning of Grand-Pr\u00e9,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bearing a nation, with all its household gods, into exile.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Exile without an end, and without an example in story.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far asunder, on separate coasts, the Acadians landed;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Scattered were they, like flakes of snow, when the wind from the northeast</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Friendless, homeless, hopeless, they wandered from city to city,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From the cold lakes of the North to sultry Southern savannas,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the Father of Waters</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seizes the hills in his hands, and drags them down to the ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Friends they sought and homes; and many, despairing, heart-broken,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a friend nor a fireside.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently suffering all things.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fair was she and young; but, alas! before her extended,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dreary and vast and silent, the desert of life, with its pathway</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Passions long extinguished, and hopes long dead and abandoned,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As the emigrant's way o'er the Western desert is marked by</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach in the sunshine.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Something there was in her life incomplete, imperfect, unfinished;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if a morning of June, with all its music and sunshine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly paused in the sky, and, fading, slowly descended</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes she lingered in towns, till, urged by the fever within her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Urged by a restless longing, the hunger and thirst of the spirit,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She would commence again her endless search and endeavor;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes in churchyards strayed, and gazed on the crosses and tombstones,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sat by some nameless grave, and thought that perhaps in its bosom</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He was already at rest, and she longed to slumber beside him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes a rumor, a hearsay, an inarticulate whisper,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But it was long ago, in some far-off place or forgotten.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Gabriel Lajeunesse!\" they said; yes!

to follow the wanderer's footsteps;\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not through each devious path, each changeful year of existence;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But as a traveller follows a streamlet's course through the valley:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far from its margin at times, and seeing the gleam of its water</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here and there, in some open space, and at intervals only;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then drawing nearer its banks, through sylvan glooms that conceal it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though he behold it not, he can hear its continuous murmur;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Happy, at length, if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><span class=\"long-line\">Canto II</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It was the month of May. Far down the Beautiful River,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Past the Ohio shore and past the mouth of the Wabash,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the golden stream of the broad and swift Mississippi,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Floated a cumbrous boat, that was rowed by Acadian boatmen.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was a band of exiles: a raft, as it were, from the shipwrecked</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nation, scattered along the coast, now floating together,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Men and women and children, who, guided by hope or by hearsay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sought for their kith and their kin among the few-acred farmers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair Opelousas.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the Father Felician.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Onward o'er sunken sands, through a wilderness sombre with forests,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Day after day they glided adown the turbulent river;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Night after night, by their blazing fires, encamped on its borders.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now through rushing chutes, among green islands, where plumelike</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cotton-trees nodded their shadowy crests, they swept with the current,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then emerged into broad lagoons, where silvery sand-bars</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lay in the stream, and along the wimpling waves of their margin,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shining with snow-white plumes, large flocks of pelicans waded.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Level the landscape grew, and along the shores of the river,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shaded by china-trees, in the midst of luxuriant gardens,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stood the houses of planters, with negro-cabins and dove-cots.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where through the Golden Coast, and groves of orange and citron,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They, too, swerved from their course; and, entering the Bayou of Plaquemine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which, like a network of steel, extended in every direction.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Met in a dusky arch, and trailing mosses in mid-air</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Deathlike the silence seemed, and unbroken, save by the herons</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Home to their roosts in the cedar-trees returning at sunset,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dreamlike, and indistinct, and strange were all things around them;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And o'er their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strange forebodings of ill, unseen and that cannot be compassed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As, at the tramp of a horse's hoof on the turf of the prairies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So, at the hoof-beats of fate, with sad forebodings of evil,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But Evangeline's heart was sustained by a vision, that faintly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through those shadowy aisles had Gabriel wandered before her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then in his place, at the prow of the boat, rose one of the oarsmen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as a signal sound, if others like them peradventure</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams, blew a blast on his bugle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Breaking the seal of silence, and giving tongues to the forest.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over the watery floor, and beneath the reverberant branches;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But not a voice replied; no answer came from the darkness;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of pain was the silence.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then Evangeline slept; but the boatmen rowed through the midnight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent at times, then singing familiar Canadian boat-songs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such as they sang of old on their own Acadian rivers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far off,\u2014indistinct,\u2014as of wave or wind in the forest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades; and before them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the Atchafalaya.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Water-lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Made by the passing oars, and, resplendent in beauty, the lotus</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with the heat of noon; and numberless sylvan islands,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Near to whose shores they glided along, invited to slumber.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Under the boughs of Wachita willows, that grew by the margin,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Safely their boat was moored; and scattered about on the greensward,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tired with their midnight toil, the weary travellers slumbered.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swinging from its great arms, the trumpet-flower and the grapevine</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of Jacob,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending, descending,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from blossom to blossom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled was her heart with love, and the dawn of an opening heaven</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Nearer, ever nearer, among the numberless islands,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Darted a light, swift boat, that sped away o'er the water,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Northward its prow was turned, to the land of the bison and beaver.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At the helm sat a youth, with countenance thoughtful and careworn.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow, and a sadness</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gabriel was it, who, weary with waiting, unhappy and restless,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swiftly they glided along, close under the lee of the island,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But by the opposite bank, and behind a screen of palmettos,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So that they saw not the boat, where it lay concealed in the willows,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All undisturbed by the dash of their oars, and unseen, were the sleepers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a cloud on the prairie.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As from a magic trance the sleepers awoke, and the maiden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Said with a sigh to the friendly priest,\u2014\"O Father Felician!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is it a foolish dream, an idle and vague superstition?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or has an angel passed, and revealed the truth to my spirit?\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, with a blush, she added,\u2014\"Alas for my credulous fancy!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But made answer the reverend man, and he smiled as he answered,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they to me without meaning.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Feeling is deep and still; and the word that floats on the surface</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gabriel truly is near thee; for not far away to the southward,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the banks of the Teche, are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There the long-wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beautiful is the land, with its prairies and forests of fruit-trees;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Under the feet a garden of flowers, and the bluest of heavens</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They who dwell there have named it the Eden of Louisiana.\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Softly the evening came. The sun from the western horizon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a magician extended his golden wand o'er the landscape;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twinkling vapors arose; and sky and water and forest</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hanging between two skies, a cloud with edges of silver,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled was Evangeline's heart with inexpressible sweetness.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Touched by the magic spell, the sacred fountains of feeling</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then from a neighboring thicket the mocking-bird, wildest of singers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung o'er the water,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Plaintive at first were the tones and sad; then soaring to madness</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Single notes were then heard, in sorrowful, low lamentation;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till, having gathered them all, he flung them abroad in derision,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As when, after a storm, a gust of wind through the tree-tops</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With such a prelude as this, and hearts that throbbed with emotion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly they entered the Teche, where it flows through the green Opelousas,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, through the amber air, above the crest of the woodland,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling;\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><span class=\"long-line\">Canto III</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Near to the bank of the river, o'ershadowed by oaks, from whose branches</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Garlands of Spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such as the Druids cut down with golden hatchets at Yule-tide,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stood, secluded and still, the house of the herdsman. A garden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filling the air with fragrance. The house itself was of timbers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hewn from the cypress-tree, and carefully fitted together.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Large and low was the roof; and on slender columns supported,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose-wreathed, vine-encircled, a broad and spacious veranda,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At each end of the house, amid the flowers of the garden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stationed the dove-cots were, as love's perpetual symbol,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Scenes of endless wooing, and endless contentions of rivals.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silence reigned o'er the place. The line of shadow and sunshine</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ran near the tops of the trees; but the house itself was in shadow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And from its chimney-top, ascending and slowly expanding</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the rear of the house, from the garden gate, ran a pathway</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Full in his track of light, like ships with shadowy canvas</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grapevines.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mounted upon his horse, with Spanish saddle and stirrups,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Broad and brown was the face that from under the Spanish sombrero</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Round about him were numberless herds of kine, that were grazing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Quietly in the meadows, and breathing the vapory freshness</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That uprose from the river, and spread itself over the landscape.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side, and expanding</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fully his broad, deep chest, he blew a blast, that resounded</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent a moment they gazed, then bellowing rushed o'er the prairie,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, as the herdsman turned to the house, through the gate of the garden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement, and forward</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gave they vent to their hearts, and renewed their friendly embraces,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thoughtful, for Gabriel came not; and now dark doubts and misgivings</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stole o'er the maiden's heart; and Basil, somewhat embarrassed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Broke the silence and said,\u2014\"If you came by the Atchafalaya,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How have you nowhere encountered my Gabriel's boat on the bayous?\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tears came into her eyes, and she said, with a tremulous accent,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Gone? is Gabriel gone?\" and, concealing her face on his shoulder,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then the good Basil said,\u2014and his voice grew blithe as he said it,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day he departed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Moody and restless grown, and tried and troubled, his spirit</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thinking ever of thee, uncertain and sorrowful ever,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ever silent, or speaking only of thee and his troubles,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tedious even to me, that at length I bethought me, and sent him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thence he will follow the Indian trails to the Ozark Mountains,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Therefore be of good cheer; we will follow the fugitive lover;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Up and away to-morrow, and through the red dew of the morning</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We will follow him fast, and bring him back to his prison.\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then glad voices were heard, and up from the banks of the river,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long under Basil's roof had he lived like a god on Olympus,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Having no other care than dispensing music to mortals.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Long live Michael,\" they cried, \"our brave Acadian minstrel!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As they bore him aloft in triumphal procession; and straightway</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Father Felician advanced with Evangeline, greeting the old man</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Kindly and oft, and recalling the past, while Basil, enraptured,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laughing loud and long, and embracing mothers and daughters.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All his domains and his herds, and his patriarchal demeanor;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And of the prairie; whose numberless herds were his who would take them;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus they ascended the steps, and, crossing the breezy veranda,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Entered the hall of the house, where already the supper of Basil</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All was silent without, and, illuming the landscape with silver,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars; but within doors,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then from his station aloft, at the head of the table, the herdsman</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lighting his pipe, that was filled with sweet Natchitoches tobacco,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus he spake to his guests, who listened, and smiled as they listened:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Welcome once more, my friends, who long have been friendless and homeless,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Welcome once more to a home, that is better perchance than the old one!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the year round the orange-groves are in blossom;

and Father Felician, astounded,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff half-way to his nostrils.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the brave Basil resumed, and his words were milder and gayer:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Only beware of the fever, my friends, beware of the fever!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For it is not like that of our cold Acadian climate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cured by wearing a spider hung round one's neck in a nutshell!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then there were voices heard at the door, and footsteps approaching</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was the neighboring Creoles and small Acadian planters,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the Herdsman.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Merry the meeting was of ancient comrades and neighbors:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Friend clasped friend in his arms; and they who before were as strangers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Meeting in exile, became straightway as friends to each other,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But in the neighboring hall a strain of music, proceeding</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From the accordant strings of Michael's melodious fiddle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Broke up all further speech. Away, like children delighted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All things forgotten beside, they gave themselves to the maddening</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whirl of the dizzy dance, as it swept and swayed to the music,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile, apart, at the head of the hall, the priest and the herdsman</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sat, conversing together of past and present and future;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While Evangeline stood like one entranced, for within her</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Olden memories rose, and loud in the midst of the music</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Heard she the sound of the sea, and an irrepressible sadness</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beautiful was the night. Behind the black wall of the forest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tipping its summit with silver, arose the moon. On the river</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nearer and round about her, the manifold flowers of the garden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Poured out their souls in odors, that were their prayers and confessions</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fuller of fragrance than they, and as heavy with shadows and night-dews,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hung the heart of the maiden. The calm and the magical moonlight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed to inundate her soul with indefinable longing;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As, through the garden gate, and beneath the shade of the oak-trees,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent it lay, with a silvery haze upon it, and fire-flies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gleaming and floating away in mingled and infinite numbers.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over her head the stars, the thoughts of God in the heavens,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if a hand had appeared and written upon them, \"Upharsin.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the soul of the maiden, between the stars and the fire-flies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wandered alone, and she cried,\u2014\"O Gabriel! O my beloved!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Art thou so near unto me, and yet I cannot behold thee?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Art thou so near unto me, and yet thy voice does not reach me?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ah! how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ah! how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ah! how often beneath this oak, returning from labor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When shall these eyes behold, these arms be folded about thee?\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a flute in the woods; and anon, through the neighboring thickets,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Patience!\" whispered the oaks from oracular caverns of darkness:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, from the moonlit meadow, a sigh responded, \"To-morrow!\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Bright rose the sun next day; and all the flowers of the garden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bathed his shining feet with their tears, and anointed his tresses</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Farewell!\" said the priest, as he stood at the shadowy threshold;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"See that you bring us the Prodigal Son from his fasting and famine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, too, the Foolish Virgin, who slept when the bridegroom was coming.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Farewell!\" answered the maiden, and, smiling, with Basil descended</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down to the river's brink, where the boatmen already were waiting.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus beginning their journey with morning, and sunshine, and gladness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not that day, nor the next, nor yet the day that succeeded,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Found they trace of his course, in lake or forest or river,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor, after many days, had they found him; but vague and uncertain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate Country;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till, at the little inn of the Spanish town of Adayes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Weary and worn, they alighted, and learned from the garrulous landlord,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That on the day before, with horses and guides and companions,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies.</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong><span class=\"long-line\">Canto IV</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Far in the West there lies a desert land, where the mountains</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lift, through perpetual snows, their lofty and luminous summits.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down from their jagged, deep ravines, where the gorge, like a gateway,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrant's wagon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Westward the Oregon flows and the Walleway and Owyhee.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Eastward, with devious course, among the Wind-river Mountains,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through the Sweet-water Valley precipitate leaps the Nebraska;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And to the south, from Fontaine-qui-bout and the Spanish sierras,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><span class=\"long-line\">Fretted with sands and rocks, and swept by the wind of the desert,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Numberless torrents, with ceaseless sound, descend to the ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and solemn vibrations.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Spreading between these streams are the wondrous, beautiful prairies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over them wandered the buffalo herds, and the elk and the roebuck;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over them wandered the wolves, and herds of riderless horses;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fires that blast and blight, and winds that are weary with travel;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over them wander the scattered tribes of Ishmael's children,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Staining the desert with blood; and above their terrible war-trails</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Circles and sails aloft, on pinions majestic, the vulture,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here and there rise groves from the margins of swift-running rivers;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the grim, taciturn bear, the anchorite monk of the desert,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook-side,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And over all is the sky, the clear and crystalline heaven,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the protecting hand of God inverted above them.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Into this wonderful land, at the base of the Ozark Mountains,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and trappers behind him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Day after day, with their Indian guides, the maiden and Basil</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o'ertake him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes they saw, or thought they saw, the smoke of his camp-fire</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rise in the morning air from the distant plain; but at nightfall,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When they had reached the place, they found only embers and ashes.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hope still guided them on, as the magic Fata Morgana</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Once, as they sat by their evening fire, there silently entered</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the little camp an Indian woman, whose features</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She was a Shawnee woman returning home to her people,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From the far-off hunting-grounds of the cruel Camanches,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where her Canadian husband, a Coureur-des-Bois, had been murdered.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Touched were their hearts at her story, and warmest and friendliest welcome</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gave they, with words of cheer, and she sat and feasted among them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when their meal was done, and Basil and all his companions,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Worn with the long day's march and the chase of the deer and the bison,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stretched themselves on the ground, and slept where the quivering fire-light</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flashed on their swarthy cheeks, and their forms wrapped up in their blankets</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then at the door of Evangeline's tent she sat and repeated</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly, with soft, low voice, and the charm of her Indian accent,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Much Evangeline wept at the tale, and to know that another</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Moved to the depths of her soul by pity and woman's compassion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She in turn related her love and all its disasters.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mute with wonder the Shawnee sat, and when she had ended</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still was mute; but at length, as if a mysterious horror</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Passed through her brain, she spake, and repeated the tale of the Mowis;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mowis, the bridegroom of snow, who won and wedded a maiden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But, when the morning came, arose and passed from the wigwam,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, in those sweet, low tones, that seemed like a weird incantation,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Told she the tale of the fair Lilinau, who was wooed by a phantom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That, through the pines o'er her father's lodge, in the hush of the twilight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Breathed like the evening wind, and whispered love to the maiden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And nevermore returned, nor was seen again by her people.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent with wonder and strange surprise, Evangeline listened</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the soft flow of her magical words, till the region around her</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly over the tops of the Ozark Mountains the moon rose,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lighting the little tent, and with a mysterious splendor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With a delicious sound the brook rushed by, and the branches</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled with the thoughts of love was Evangeline's heart, but a secret,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was no earthly fear. A breath from the region of spirits</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed to float in the air of night; and she felt for a moment</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Early upon the morrow the march was resumed; and the Shawnee</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Said, as they journeyed along,\u2014\"On the western slope of these mountains</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Much he teaches the people, and tells them of Mary and Jesus;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Loud laugh their hearts with joy, and weep with pain, as they hear him.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, with a sudden and secret emotion, Evangeline answered,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Let us go to the Mission, for there good tidings await us!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thither they turned their steeds; and behind a spur of the mountains,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Just as the sun went down, they heard a murmur of voices,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in a meadow green and broad, by the bank of a river,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Under a towering oak, that stood in the midst of the village,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knelt the Black Robe chief with his children. A crucifix fastened</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">High on the trunk of the tree, and overshadowed by grapevines,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This was their rural chapel. Aloft, through the intricate arches</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of its aerial roof, arose the chant of their vespers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent, with heads uncovered, the travellers, nearer approaching,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when the service was done, and the benediction had fallen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Forth from the hands of the priest, like seed from the hands of the sower,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers, and bade them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Welcome; and when they replied, he smiled with benignant expression,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hearing the homelike sounds of his mother-tongue in the forest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, with words of kindness, conducted them into his wigwam.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There upon mats and skins they reposed, and on cakes of the maize-ear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon was their story told; and the priest with solemnity answered:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Not six suns have risen and set since Gabriel, seated</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On this mat by my side, where now the maiden reposes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soft was the voice of the priest, and he spake with an accent of kindness;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But on Evangeline's heart fell his words as in winter the snow-flakes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Far to the north he has gone,\" continued the priest; \"but in autumn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the chase is done, will return again to the Mission.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then Evangeline said, and her voice was meek and submissive,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Let me remain with thee, for my soul is sad and afflicted.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So seemed it wise and well unto all; and betimes on the morrow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mounting his Mexican steed, with his Indian guides and companions.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Homeward Basil returned, and Evangeline stayed at the Mission.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Slowly, slowly, slowly the days succeeded each other,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Days and weeks and months; and the fields of maize that were springing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Green from the ground when a stranger she came, now waving above her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lifted their slender shafts, with leaves interlacing, and forming</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then in the golden weather the maize was husked, and the maidens</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Blushed at each blood-red ear, for that betokened a lover,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But at the crooked laughed, and called it a thief in the corn-field.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Patience!\" the priest would say; \"have faith, and thy prayer will be answered!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">See how its leaves are turned to the north, as true as the magnet;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This is the compass-flower, that the finger of God has planted</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here in the houseless wild, to direct the traveller's journey</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over the sea-like, pathless, limitless waste of the desert.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such in the soul of man is faith.

and the pathway</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which she had climbed so far, lying smooth and fair in the distance.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gabriel was not forgotten. Within her heart was his image,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clothed in the beauty of love and youth, as last she beheld him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into her thoughts of him time entered not, for it was not.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over him years had no power; he was not changed, but transfigured;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He had become to her heart as one who is dead, and not absent;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Patience and abnegation of self, and devotion to others,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So was her love diffused, but, like to some odorous spices,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suffered no waste nor loss, though filling the air with aroma.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Other hope had she none, nor wish in life, but to follow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Meekly, with reverent steps, the sacred feet of her Saviour.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus many years she lived as a Sister of Mercy; frequenting</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Night after night, when the world was asleep, as the watchman repeated</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Loud, through the gusty streets, that all was well in the city,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">High at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Day after day, in the gray of the dawn, as slow through the suburbs</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Plodded the German farmer, with flowers and fruits for the market,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Met he that meek, pale face, returning home from its watchings.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Presaged by wondrous signs, and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Darkening the sun in their flight, with naught in their craws but an acorn.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as the tides of the sea arise in the month of September,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flooding some silver stream, till it spreads to a lake in the meadow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So death flooded life, and, o'erflowing its natural margin,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Spread to a brackish lake, the silver stream of existence.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wealth had no power to bribe, nor beauty to charm, the oppressor;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger;\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only, alas! the poor, who had neither friends nor attendants,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Crept away to die in the almshouse, home of the homeless.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then in the suburbs it stood, in the midst of meadows and woodlands;\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now the city surrounds it; but still, with its gateway and wicket</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Meek, in the midst of splendor, its humble walls seem to echo</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Softly the words of the Lord:\u2014\"The poor ye always have with you.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thither, by night and by day, came the Sister of Mercy. The dying</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Looked up into her face, and thought, indeed, to behold there</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such as the artist paints o'er the brows of saints and apostles,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or such as hangs by night o'er a city seen at a distance.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus, on a Sabbath morn, through the streets, deserted and silent,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wending her quiet way, she entered the door of the almshouse.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, as she mounted the stairs to the corridors, cooled by the east-wind,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of Christ Church,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While, intermingled with these, across the meadows were wafted</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sounds of psalms, that were sung by the Swedes in their church at Wicaco.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Something within her said,\u2014\"At length thy trials are ended\";</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, with light in her looks, she entered the chambers of sickness.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Noiselessly moved about the assiduous, careful attendants,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Moistening the feverish lip, and the aching brow, and in silence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Closing the sightless eyes of the dead, and concealing their faces,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where on their pallets they lay, like drifts of snow by the roadside.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Many a languid head, upraised as Evangeline entered,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed, for her presence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as she looked around, she saw how Death, the consoler,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Vacant their places were, or filled already by strangers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly, as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still she stood, with her colorless lips apart, while a shudder</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ran through her frame, and, forgotten, the flowerets dropped from her fingers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That the dying heard it, and started up from their pillows.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long, and thin, and gray were the locks that shaded his temples;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But, as he lay in the in morning light, his face for a moment</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if life, like the Hebrew, with blood had besprinkled its portals,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That the Angel of Death might see the sign, and pass over.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Motionless, senseless, dying, he lay, and his spirit exhausted</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Darkness of slumber and death, forever sinking and sinking.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then through those realms of shade, in multiplied reverberations,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Heard he that cry of pain, and through the hush that succeeded</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whispered a gentle voice, in accents tender and saint-like,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Gabriel! O my beloved!\" and died away into silence.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then he beheld, in a dream, once more the home of his childhood;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Green Acadian meadows, with sylvan rivers among them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Village, and mountain, and woodlands; and, walking under their shadow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As in the days of her youth, Evangeline rose in his vision.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tears came into his eyes; and as slowly he lifted his eyelids,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Vanished the vision away, but Evangeline knelt by his bedside.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Vainly he strove to whisper her name, for the accents unuttered</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Died on his lips, and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Vainly he strove to rise; and Evangeline, kneeling beside him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Kissed his dying lips, and laid his head on her bosom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sweet was the light of his eyes; but it suddenly sank into darkness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">All was ended now, the hope, and the fear, and the sorrow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the dull, deep pain, and constant anguish of patience!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Meekly she bowed her own, and murmured, \"Father, I thank thee!\"</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Still stands the forest primeval; but far away from its shadow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Side by side, in their nameless graves, the lovers are sleeping.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Under the humble walls of the little Catholic churchyard,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the heart of the city, they lie, unknown and unnoticed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thousands of throbbing hearts, where theirs are at rest and forever,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thousands of aching brains, where theirs no longer are busy,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thousands of toiling hands, where theirs have ceased from their labors,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thousands of weary feet, where theirs have completed their journey!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Still stands the forest primeval; but under the shade of its branches</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dwells another race, with other customs and language.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only along the shore of the mournful and misty Atlantic</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Linger a few Acadian peasants, whose fathers from exile</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the fisherman's cot the wheel and the loom are still busy;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Maidens still wear their Norman caps and their kirtles of homespun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And by the evening fire repeat Evangeline's story,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While from its rocky caverns the deep-voiced, neighboring ocean</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speaks, and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Henry V, Act V, Scene III [What&#039;s he that wishes so?]", "view_node": "/poem/henry-v-act-v-scene-iii-whats-he-wishes-so", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-shakespeare\" hreflang=\"und\">William Shakespeare</a>", "field_date_published": "1600", "body": " <p><i>King Henry to Westmoreland</i><br /><br />What's he that wishes so?<br />My cousin Westmoreland?

about cheese.<br />I fell in love with my husband,<br /><br />not when he told me<br />what the word \"apercus\" means,<br /><br />but when I looked it up,<br />and he was right.<br /><br />There\u2019s even a word<br />for when you use a word<br /><br />not to mean its meaning,<br />but as a word itself,<br /><br />and I\u2019d tell you what it was<br />if I could remember it.<br /><br />My friend reads the dictionary<br />for its perspective on culture,<br /><br />laughs when I say that<br />reference books are not really<br /><br />books, but proleptic databases.<br />My third grade teacher<br /><br />used to joke that if we were bored<br />we could copy pages out of the dictionary,<br /><br />but when I did, also as a joke,<br />she was horrified rather than amused.<br /><br />Discovery is always tinged<br />with sorrow, the knowledge<br /><br />that you have been living<br />without something,<br /><br />so we try to make learning<br />the province of the young,<br /><br />who have less time to regret<br />having lived in ignorance.<br /><br />My students are lost<br />in dictionaries,<br /><br />unable to figure out why<br />\"categorize\" means<br /><br />\"to put into categories\"<br />or why the fifth definition<br /><br />of \"standard\" is the one<br />that will make the sentence<br /><br />in question make sense.<br />I wonder how anyone<br /><br />can live without knowing<br />the word \"wonder.\"<br /><br />A famous author<br />once said in an interview,<br /><br />that he ended his novel<br />with an obscure word<br /><br />he was sure his reader<br />would not know<br /><br />because he liked the idea<br />of the reader looking it up.<br /><br />He wanted the reader,<br />upon closing his book, to open<br /><br />another, that second book<br />being a dictionary,<br /><br />and however much I may have loved<br />that author, after reading<br /><br />that story<br />(and this may surprise you)<br /><br />I loved him less.</p> "}, {"title": "Lines to a Nasturtium", "view_node": "/poem/lines-nasturtium", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/anne-spencer\" hreflang=\"und\">Anne Spencer</a>",
