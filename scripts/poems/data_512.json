About the Dead Man and Fungi\n\nThe dead man has changed his mind about moss and mold.\nAbout mildew and yeast.\nAbout rust and smut, about soot and ash.\nWhereas once he turned from the sour and the decomposed, now he breathes deeply in the underbelly\n     of the earth.\nOf mushrooms, bakers yeast, fungi of wood decay, and the dogs preceding their masters to the\n     burnt acre of morels.\nAnd the little seasonals themselves, stuck on their wobbly pin stems. \nFor in the pan they float without crisping.\nFor they are not without a hint of the sublime, nor the curl of a hand.\nThese are the caps and hairdos, the mini-umbrellas, the zeppelins of a world in which human\n     beings are heavy-footed mammoths.\nPuffballs and saucers, recurrent, recumbent, they fill the encyclopedia.\nNot wrought for the pressed eternity of flowers or butterflies.\nLoners and armies alike appearing overnight at the point of return.\nThey live fast, they die young, they will be back.\n\n\n2. More About the Dead Man and Fungi\n\nFruit of the fungi, a mushroom's birthing is an arrow from below.\nIt is because of Zeno's Paradox that one cannot get there by half-measures.\nIt is the fault of having anything else to do.\nThe dead man prefers the mushroom of the gatherer to that of the farmer.\nGilled or ungilled, stemmed or stemless, woody or leathery, the mushroom is secretive, yes, by\n     nature.\nEach mushroom was a button, each a flowering, some glow in the dark.\nMedicinal or toxic, each was lopped from the stump of eternity.\nThe dead man has seen them take the shapes of cups and saucers, of sponges, logs and bird nests. \nThe dead man probes the shadows, he fingers the crannies and undersides, he spots the mushroom\n     underfoot just in time.\nWhen the dead man saw a mushrooming cloud above Hiroshima, he knew.\nHe saw that death was beautiful from afar.\nHe saw that nature is equidistant from the nourishing and the poisonous, the good and the bad,\n     the beginning and the end.\nHe knew the littlest mushroom, shivering on its first day, was a signal.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Adam&#039;s Curse", "view_node": "/poem/adams-curse", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/w-b-yeats\" hreflang=\"und\">W.
