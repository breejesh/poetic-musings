ear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And deemed our chance to do so dear.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We loved to watch the warrior Sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 With flaming shield and flaunting crest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Go striding down the gory West,</span><br /><span

sight.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Then first I saw the need and might</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of that fair band, the singing throng,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Who, gifted with the skill divine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Take up the threads of life, spun fine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And weave them into soulful song.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They sung for me, whose passion pressing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 My soul, found vent in song nor line.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They bore the burden of expressing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 All that I felt, with art's design,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And every word of theirs was mine.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I read them to Ione, ofttimes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 By hill and shore, beneath fair skies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And she looked deeply in mine eyes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And knew my love spoke through their rhymes.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Her life was like the stream that floweth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And mine was like the waiting sea;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her love was like the flower that bloweth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And mine was like the searching bee\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 I found her sweetness all for me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">God plied him in the mint of time,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And coined for us a golden day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And rolled it ringing down life's way</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With love's sweet music in its chime.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And God unclasped the Book of Ages,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And laid it open to our sight;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Upon the dimness of its pages,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 So long consigned to rayless night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 He shed the glory of his light.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We read them well, we read them long,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And ever thrilling did we see</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 That love ruled all humanity,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The master passion, pure and strong.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">III.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">To-day my skies are bare and ashen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And bend on me without a beam.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since love is held the master-passion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Its loss must be the pain supreme\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And grinning Fate has wrecked my dream.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But pardon, dear departed Guest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 I will not rant, I will not rail;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 For good the grain must feel the flail;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There are whom love has never blessed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I had and have a younger brother,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 One whom I loved and love to-day</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As never fond and doting mother</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Adored the babe who found its way</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 From heavenly scenes into her day.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Oh, he was full of youth's new wine,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 A man on life's ascending slope,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Flushed with ambition, full of hope;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And every wish of his was mine.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A kingly youth; the way before him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Was thronged with victories to be won;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So joyous, too, the heavens o'er him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Were bright with an unchanging sun,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 His days with rhyme were overrun.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Toil had not taught him Nature's prose,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Tears had not dimmed his brilliant eyes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And sorrow had not made him wise;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His life was in the budding rose.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I know not how I came to waken,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Some instinct pricked my soul to sight;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My heart by some vague thrill was shaken,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 A thrill so true and yet so slight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 I hardly deemed I read aright.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As when a sleeper, ign'rant why,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Not knowing what mysterious hand</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Has called him out of slumberland,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Starts up to find some danger nigh.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Love is a guest that comes, unbidden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 But, having come, asserts his right;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He will not be repressed nor hidden.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And so my brother's dawning plight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Became uncovered to my sight.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some sound-mote in his passing tone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Caught in the meshes of my ear;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Some little glance, a shade too dear,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Betrayed the love he bore Ione.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">What could I do? He was my brother,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And young, and full of hope and trust;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I could not, dared not try to smother</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 His flame, and turn his heart to dust.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 I knew how oft life gives a crust</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To starving men who cry for bread;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 But he was young, so few his days,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 He had not learned the great world's ways,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor Disappointment's volumes read.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">However fair and rich the booty,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 I could not make his loss my gain.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For love is dear, but dearer, duty,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And here my way was clear and plain.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 I saw how I could save him pain.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And so, with all my day grown dim,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 That this loved brother's sun might shine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 I joined his suit, gave over mine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And sought Ione, to plead for him.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I found her in an eastern bower,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Where all day long the am'rous sun</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lay by to woo a timid flower.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 This day his course was well-nigh run,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 But still with lingering art he spun</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gold fancies on the shadowed wall.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 The vines waved soft and green above,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And there where one might tell his love,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I told my griefs\u2014I told her all!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I told her all, and as she hearkened,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 A tear-drop fell upon her dress.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With grief her flushing brow was darkened;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 One sob that she could not repress</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Betrayed the depths of her distress.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Upon her grief my sorrow fed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And I was bowed with unlived years,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 My heart swelled with a sea of tears,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The tears my manhood could not shed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The world is Rome, and Fate is Nero,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Disporting in the hour of doom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">God made us men; times make the hero\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 But in that awful space of gloom</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 I gave no thought but sorrow's room.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All\u2014all was dim within that bower,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 What time the sun divorced the day;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And all the shadows, glooming gray,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Proclaimed the sadness of the hour.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">She could not speak\u2014no word was needed;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Her look, half strength and half despair,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Told me I had not vainly pleaded,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 That she would not ignore my prayer.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And so she turned and left me there,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as she went, so passed my bliss;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 She loved me, I could not mistake\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 But for her own and my love's sake,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her womanhood could rise to this!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">My wounded heart fled swift to cover,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 And life at times seemed very drear.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My brother proved an ardent lover\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 What had so young a man to fear?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 He wed Ione within the year.</span><br /><span
