Were they to see my hands, brown \nas your dear face, they'd know I'm not quite \nwhat I pretend to be. I walk these streets \na white woman, or so I think, until I catch the eyes \nof some stranger upon me, and I must lower mine, \na <i>negress</i> again. There are enough things here \nto remind me who I am. Mules lumbering through \nthe crowded streets send me into reverie, their footfall \nthe sound of a pointer and chalk hitting the blackboard \nat school, only louder. Then there are women, clicking \ntheir tongues in conversation, carrying their loads \non their heads. Their husky voices, the wash pots \nand irons of the laundresses call to me.\n\nI thought not to do the work I once did, back bending \nand domestic; my schooling a gift--even those half days\nat picking time, listening to Miss J--. How \nI'd come to know words, the recitations I practiced \nto sound like her, lilting, my sentences curling up\nor trailing off at the ends. I read my books until\nI nearly broke their spines, and in the cotton field,\nI repeated whole sections I'd learned by heart,\nspelling each word in my head to make a picture\nI could see, as well as a weight I could feel\nin my mouth.

Bugs strafed the beam, reared\nfrom the black, threading it again, and again. He didn't \n\ncall out or raise his free hand or even target his lamp\non my head, just kept cresting the weeds with the twin \nbrows of his knees while scanning the foreground\n\nfor snags. Whether it was that he couldn't imagine me \nthere, and therefore I wasn't, or that my body actually \nweighed in at nothing, doused as it was in that field's\n\nferal moulting, bucking, breathing--its bull-stubborn \nmorphing of intrauterine moments--I couldn't decide.\nThere wasn't time. He passed on the left, dragged by\n\nthis light as if some shadowy leashed mastiff tractored\nhim on, plunging through weed.
