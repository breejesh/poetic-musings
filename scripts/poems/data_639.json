Wisdom, said William James,\n\nIs learning what to overlook.  And I am wise\nIf that is wisdom.\nYet somehow, as I buy All from these shelves\nAnd the boy takes it to my station wagon,\nWhat I've become\nTroubles me even if I shut my eyes.\n\nWhen I was young and miserable and pretty\nAnd poor, I'd wish\nWhat all girls wish: to have a husband,\nA house and children.  Now that I'm old, my wish\nIs womanish:\nThat the boy putting groceries in my car\n\nSee me.  It bewilders me he doesn't see me.\nFor so many years\nI was good enough to eat: the world looked at me\nAnd its mouth watered.  How often they have undressed me,\nThe eyes of strangers!\nAnd, holding their flesh within my flesh, their vile\n\nImaginings within my imagining,\nI too have taken\nThe chance of life.  Now the boy pats my dog\nAnd we start home.  Now I am good.\nThe last mistaken,\nEcstatic, accidental bliss, the blind\n\nHappiness that, bursting, leaves upon the palm\nSome soap and water--\nIt was so long ago, back in some Gay\nTwenties, Nineties, I don't know . . . Today I miss\nMy lovely daughter\nAway at school, my sons away at school,\n\nMy husband away at work--I wish for them.\nThe dog, the maid,\nAnd I go through the sure unvarying days\nAt home in them.  As I look at my life,\nI am afraid\nOnly that it will change, as I am changing:\n\nI am afraid, this morning, of my face.\nIt looks at me\nFrom the rear-view mirror, with the eyes I hate,\nThe smile I hate.  Its plain, lined look\nOf gray discovery\nRepeats to me: \"You're old.\"  That's all, I'm old.\n\nAnd yet I'm afraid, as I was at the funeral\nI went to yesterday.\nMy friend's cold made-up face, granite among its flowers,\nHer undressed, operated-on, dressed body\nWere my face and body.\nAs I think of her I hear her telling me\n\nHow young I seem; I <i>am</i> exceptional;\nI think of all I have.\nBut really no one is exceptional,\nNo one has anything, I'm anybody,\nI stand beside my grave\nConfused with my life, that is commonplace and solitary.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "A Season (audio

Was the house real?\"\nAn angel flew in and out of the high window\nIn the factory where the man worked, his hands\nNumb with cold. He hated the window &amp; the light\nEntering the window &amp; he hated the angel.\nBecause the angel could not be carved into meat\nOr dumped into the ossuary &amp; become part\nOf the landfill at the edge of town,\nIt therefore could not acquire a soul,\nAnd resembled in significance nothing more\nThan a light summer dress when the body has gone.\n\nThe man survived because, after a while, \nHe shut up about it.\n\nStalin had a deep understanding of the <i>kulaks</i>, \nTheir sense of marginalization &amp; belief in the land;\n\nThat is why he killed them all.\n\nMembers of the Committee on Solitude, consider\nOur own impoverishment &amp; the progress of that famine,\nIn which, now, it is becoming impossible\nTo feel anything when we contemplate the burial,\nAlive, in a two-hour period, of hundreds of people.\nWho were not clich\u00e9s, who did not know they would be\nThe illegible blank of the past that lives in each\nOf us, even in some guy watering his lawn\n\nOn a summer night. Consider\n\nThe death of Stalin &amp; the slow, uninterrupted\nEvolution of the horse, a species no one,\nNot even Stalin, could extinguish, almost as if\nWhat could not be altered was something\nNoble in the look of its face, something\n\nIncapable of treachery.\n\nThen imagine, in your planning proposals,\nThe exact moment in the future when an angel\nMight alight &amp; crawl like a fly into the ear of a horse,\nAnd then, eventually, into the brain of a horse,\nAnd imagine further that the angel in the brain\nOf this horse is, for the horse cropping grass\nIn the field, largely irrelevant, a mist in the corner\nOf the field, something that disappears,\nThe horse thinks, when weight is passed through it,\nSomething that will not even carry the weight\nOf its own father\nOn its back, the horse decides, &amp; so demonstrates\nThis by swishing at a fly with its tail, by continuing\nTo graze as the dusk comes on &amp; almost until it is night.\n\nOld contrivers, daydreamers, walking chemistry sets,\nExhausted chimneysweeps of the spaces\nBetween words, where the Holy Ghost tastes just\nLike the dust it is made of,\nLet's tear up our lecture notes &amp; throw them out\nThe window.\nLet's do it right now before wisdom descends upon us\nLike a spiderweb over a burned-out theater marquee,\nBecause what's the use?\nI keep going to meetings where no one's there,\nAnd contributing to the discussion;\nAnd besides, behind the angel hissing in its mist\nIs a gate that leads only into another field,\nAnother outcropping of stones &amp; withered grass, where\nA horse named Sandman &amp; a horse named Anastasia\nUsed to stand at the fence &amp; watch the traffic pass.\nWhere there were outdoor concerts once, in summer,\nUnder the missing &amp; innumerable stars.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Private Eye Lettuce", "view_node": "/poem/private-eye-lettuce", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/richard-brautigan\" hreflang=\"und\">Richard Brautigan</a>", "field_date_published": "1989", "body": " <pre>\nThree crates of Private Eye Lettuce, \nthe name and drawing of a detective \nwith magnifying glass on the sides \nof the crates of lettuce, \nform a great cross in man's imagination \nand his desire to name \nthe objects of this world. \nI think I'll call this place Golgotha \nand have some salad for dinner.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The First Winter Snow", "view_node": "/poem/first-winter-snow", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/richard-brautigan\" hreflang=\"und\">Richard Brautigan</a>", "field_date_published": "1989", "body": " <pre>\nOh, pretty girl, you have trapped \nyourself in the wrong body.
