A poet you would LOVE to correspond with, but it's too late? Take notes about this missed opportunity. What is your favorite poem by this poet? Write it on unlined paper by hand (no typing). If we were gods we wouldn't need to invent beautiful poems, and that's why our lives are more interesting, and that's why the gods are always meddling in our affairs out of boredom. It's like the fascination the rich have with the poor, as Alice Notley says, \"the poor are more interesting than others, almost uniformly.\" This poem was written by a human poet, and we humans love our poets, if we have any sense. Does something strike flint in you from the process of engaging your body to write this poem you know and love? Notes, notes, take notes.</p><p>The poet for me in doing this exercise is Jim Brodey and his poem \"Little Light,\" which he wrote in the bathtub while listening to the music of Eric Dolphy, masturbating in the middle of the poem, \"while the soot-tinted noise of too-full streets echoes / and I pick up the quietly diminishing soap &amp; do / myself again.\" Take your handwritten version of the poem and cut it into tiny confetti. Heat olive oil in a frying pan and toss the confetti poem in. Add garlic, onion, parsnip, whatever you want, pepper it, salt it, serve it over noodles or rice. Eat the delicious poem with a nice glass of red wine, pausing to read it out loud and toast the poet, \"MANY APOLOGIES FOR NOT TOASTING YOU WHEN YOU WERE ALIVE!\" Take notes while slowly chewing the poem. Chew slowly so your saliva breaks the poem down before it slides into your belly to feed your blood and cells of your body. Gather your notes, write your poem.</p><br
