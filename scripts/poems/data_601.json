One moon rose.\nA second moon\n\nrose on the windshield of a car and he thanked them both.\nThis was the time of his seeing. This was the time.\nAn electric green beetle shuttled out\nof the darkness\n\nand landed on his forearm, pulsing, he didn't remove it.\nIt seemed relieved. Some things work very hard\nto leave the ground. Somewhere an infant\ncalled out, sharply,\n\nwas comforted into silence. The deep note of an owl opened a tunnel \nin the air. He was growing tired. He didn\u2019t want to stop. \nThe world opened. \nA line began.\n\nIt traveled out ahead of him and returned, tracing a wave,\nwhite foam gathering, gathering the moonlight,\nblack water rising into a wall\nand he held up his hand:\n\nthe wall froze, trembling, the head of a seal\npoked through, looked around, withdrew,\nhe liked the way its whiskers\nbent forward\n\nas it withdrew and he liked the way his hand had stopped a wave\nso he thanked his hand and moved on,\ninto the outskirts, the taste\nof salt on his tongue,\n\nthe taste of brine, it made him thirsty although he had no thirst.\nThis was the time of his seeing. This was the time.\nAnd the skeletal shadow of a radio tower\nloomed to the right of him,\n\ncreaking, a red gleam, then nothing, he thought he heard music\npassing through him and he was right: \nhe was humming something\nfrom a song, \n\nbut he couldn't remember the words, which was fine, \nthey were sentimental anyway so he \nthanked the radio tower\nand kept moving,\n\nthe road turning to gravel, the gravel turning to dust,\nthe ditches sang with frogs, the ditches were silent,\na pair of yellow eyes waited for him\nto pass and so he passed,\n\ncalmly, since the beetle was with him, trying to refold its wings,\nand the tree was with him, unfolding its leaves,\nand a man was with him, walking at his side\n\u2014he didn't need to ask\n\nwho he was, so he didn't, but in the corner of his eye\nhe caught a glimpse: he seemed familiar,\nhe looked like him\nand he was,\n\nalthough a string of numbers was carved into his side.\nHe asked if he could touch them and he said Yes,\ntouch them. They were cold numbers.\nThey were pearls.\n\nHe asked if he could kiss him and he said Yes, kiss me, and so he did.\nIt was a strange kiss. It was a beautiful kiss.\nIt seemed to last a long time.\nIt seemed to last a lifetime.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Wild Is the Wind", "view_node": "/poem/wild-wind", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/travis-nichols\" hreflang=\"und\">Travis Nichols</a>", "field_date_published": "2005", "body": " <pre>\nThere is a movie called \"She's Gotta Have It.\"\nThere is a blizzard in Massachusetts today.\nTwenty-one people died in Chicago last night.\nTwo of my friends live there,\nbut I have never wanted to live there\nbecause it is cold there and people die\nfrom the cold and the wind and from each other.\nThere is a movie called \"Chicago.\"\nI saw it yesterday in Massachusetts.\nThe wind is shaking our house this morning\nbut it's warm inside.

Locally canonized,\nthey lead quiet, celibate, nunnish lives,\njoining after they\u2019ve been mothers and wives,\nat between fifty and seventy years of age:\na sisterhood of sages in matronage.\n\nWe drove on Salvador\u2019s four-lane boulevards,\npast unpainted cement houses, and billboards,\nand pedestrians wearing plastic shoes,\nand little shops, and streets, and avenues,\na park, a mall . . . Our guide was excellent:\nfluent in English, and intelligent,\nwilling to answer questions patiently\nand to wait out our jokes. The history\nof Salvador flew past. At Tororo\nwe slowed as much as the traffic would allow,\nto see the Orixas dancing on the lake\nin their bright skirts. The road we took\nsped past high-rise apartment neighborhoods,\nthen scattered shacks, then nothing but deep woods\nof trees I didn\u2019t recognize and lands\nthat seemed to be untouched by human hands.\nWe stopped in a village, where it was market day.\nWe walked among the crowds, taller than they\nand kilos heavier, tasting jackfruit\nand boiled peanuts, embraced by absolute,\nrespectful welcome, like visiting gods\nwhose very presence is good news. Our guide\nsuggested a rest stop. We were sipping Coke\nwhen a man came into the shop and quietly spoke\nto our guide, who translated his request:\nWould we come to his nightclub, be his guests?\nWe didn\u2019t understand, but shrugged and went\na few doors down the street. \"What does he want?\"\nwe asked. The club hadn\u2019t been opened yet;\nby inviting us in, the owner hoped to get\nour blessings for it. Which we humbly gave:\nvisiting rich American descendants of slaves.\n\nFor hours we drove through a deep wilderness,\nlaughing like children on a field-trip bus.\nWe made a side trip to the family home\nof Bahia\u2019s favorite daughter and son,\nthe Velosos, Bethania and Caetano,\nin the small town of Santo Amaro.\nThe greenery flew by until the descent\ninto a river valley. There we went\nto a nice little restaurant to dine\non octopus stew, rice, manioc, and wine.\nThen we crossed a rickety bridge behind a dray\ndrawn by a donkey, and wended our way,\nat last, to Cachoeira, an old town\nof colonial buildings, universally tan\nand shuttered, darkly lining narrow streets.\nA tethered rooster pecked around our feet\nin the souvenir shop. At the convent\nI wondered what the statues really meant:\nWas it Mary, or was it Yemanja\nin the chapel, blue-robed, over the altar?\nWas it Mary on the glass-enclosed bier,\nher blue robe gold-embroidered, pearls in her hair,\nor was it the Orixa of the sea?\nThere were no Sisters around for us to see;\nthey were in solitude, preparing for the Feast\nof the Assumption, when the Virgin passed\npainlessly from this world into the next,\n<i>Aiye</i> to <i>Orun</i>. Posters showed them decked\nout for their big Assumption Day parade,\nbig, handsome mamas wearing Orixa beads,\nwhite turbans and blouses, red shawls, black skirts.\nThe man in their gift shop was an expert\non the Sisters\u2019 long struggle to find a way\nto serve the Christian Church and Candombl .\nThe eldest Sister is called \"the Perpetual Judge\";\nevery seventh year, she becomes the bridge\non which the Virgin Mary crosses back,\nsorrowing love incarnate in a black\nninety-odd-year-old woman facing death\nand saying <i>Magnificat</i> with every breath.\n\nWe drove out of the valley looking back\non lightbulbs which intensified the thick,\nincomprehensible, mysterious\ndarkness of the unknown.
