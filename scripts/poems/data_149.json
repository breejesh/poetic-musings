Endless blueness. White is blue. An ocean wave freezes in place. Blue. Whole glaciers, large as Ohio, floating masses of static water. All of them pale frosted azuls. It makes me wonder\u2014yet again\u2014was there ever such a thing as whiteness? I am beginning to grow suspicious. An open window.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I am blue.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am a frozen blue ocean.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am a wave struck cold in midair.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The wave is nude beneath her blue dress.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her skin is blue.</span></p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">To arrive in a place.</span></p>\n\n<p>And this place in which you have arrived finally: a place you have always dreamt of arriving. Perhaps you have tried\u2014for eighteen years\u2014to get there, dreaming of landscapes, people, food. Always repulsed by your effort, unable to attain the trophy.</p>\n\n<p>And then finally somehow you arrive one day and are immediately stunned because you realize more than anything, it isn\u2019t the landscape, food, the people. That thing which most astonishes you is the light, the way the air appears, how the sunlight hovers just before your eyes.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>And you\u2014then\u2014wanting nothing more than to spend the day indoors watching the room. The vast ocean always nothing more than an open window. So you stay inside and choose to watch the same wall turn fifty reds, then later: slow, countless variations of blue. Blues you have never seen. There is a black beam overhead on the ceiling. Without it, the ability to see such light would disappear. The light is toying with you, and you like it. All of this because the darkness is now always overhead. That. That is what arriving means.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>I want to say the same thing in a variety of different ways. Or I want to say many different things, but merely one way.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps there is only one word after all. Beneath all languages, beneath all other words: only one. Perhaps whenever we speak we are repeating it. All day long, the same single word over and over again.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>Choose something dark. Choose a dark line to hang above you. If you want to see what light can do, always choose the dark.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>Out on the ice, the light can blind you. The annals laced with men who set out without the protection of darkness. All finished blind.</p>\n\n<p>Blackbirds, black bowhead whales, the raven, the night sky, the body inside, blue ink, pencil lead, chocolate, marzipan. Like us.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">All water is color. But what does that have to do with you and me, Matthew?</span></p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>Maybe life is just this: walking with each other from one dark room to another. And looking.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes the paintings come to life. Sometimes you just love the word pewter. Sometimes the ocean waves at you. Sometimes there are goldfish in a jar. A bowl of oranges. Sometimes a woman steps down out of a frame and walks toward you. Sometimes she discards the white scarf, which covers her, and reveals her real body. Sometimes she leaves, moments later, covered in a striped jacket and leather hat.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Our lady of the dressing table.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Our lady of the rainy day.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Our lady of palm leaves, periwinkle, calla lilies.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Our lady of acanthus.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A garden redone three times.</span></p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes someone you love just falls through. Gone. The blue massive ridges of pressure shift, float away, move. Sometimes the ice breaks open. That\u2019s it. Sledge, dogs and all.</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>I fell through once. I\u2019d grown cold, so I stood up and walked to get my coat. I was told it was hanging on the far wall of a very dark room. Because it was dark, I could see, really see\u2014for the first time\u2014how a particular gold thread sparkled on the collar. I reached out my hand. But before the wall, there was a large hole where stairs were being built, which I could not see. I walked into air and landed on my head. Underground.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Everything then turned a vivid black.</span></p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>I wonder, Matthew, when you were out on the ice for years, trying very hard not to fall through, I wonder whether\u2014like me\u2014you ever thought of the same woman over and over again, whether you ever imagined her draped in a loose-fitting emerald robe, seated in a pink velvet chair, engulfed by a black so bright it was luminous?</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I do.</span></p>\n\n<p>Sometimes I lie here in bed before the fire, unable to move\u2014this cane, this hideous cane, this glorious cane, cutting cane\u2014and imagine that one particular curl falling forward toward her forehead. I imagine the same curl at this angle, then that. A recurring dream. When my bed becomes a vast field of frozen ice the color of indigo, and I cannot move, I begin to see her face. Each strand of her hair becomes a radiant small flame, twisting and burning so quietly. Then I look at your picture, you out on the ice, and I wonder if you ever feel like that, Matthew?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Like a woman, faceless and flung over</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a desk, at rest or in tears, exquisite</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">quickly drawn ruffles about your shoulder,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">halos of wide banana leaves</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">hovering just above your head?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Were there images you could not fling</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">from your mind? Events that clung</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to you, coated you, repeating</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">themselves in a series: movements</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or instruments in a symphony?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Objects that would not let you go:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">an avocado tree; a certain street</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">at night where someone exceptionally kind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">once took your arm as the two of you walked</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">along a wet sidewalk; trying</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to remember the light on that certain gait:</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">your mother twirling a parasol, also walking</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">through a grove of olive trees?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Did you begin to find comfort</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the serial, the inexplicable and constant</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">reappearance of things, people, sensations,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">every moment symphonically realized</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and reentered. The way the days begin</span><br />\nto rhyme. Every moment</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">walking into the room again.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sledge after sledge.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Matthew?</span></p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>I fell through, into a hole in the floor. I landed far below, on my head. Sometimes I still forget my name. Sometimes I forget yours. Sometimes I forget how to spell <em>the</em>. Regularly I am unable to remember Adam Clayton Powell. Or how to conjugate <em>exist</em>. Sometimes I lie in bed and cannot feel my legs. It\u2019s like something quietly gnawed them off while I was in the kitchen making tea. From the knees down: this odd sensation, not nothing, but something, just not legs. If ice were not cold perhaps. Or the memory of a leg. I cannot feel my legs, but I can feel their memory.</p>\n\n<p>In conversation, my face goes numb. It starts at my mouth and spreads out. When I am quiet it recedes. Why is numbness ascribed the color blue? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s red.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the day, my left hand has disappeared from the end of my arm. I ignore it. Hold my pen. Smile at you. What year is it, darling? I once lived where? With whom? Where is she now? What was her name?</p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>I remember nurses. Their faces. Someone very, very kind\u2014a woman\u2014began to tape a pen inside my hand. I remember being suspended in a harness. Being lowered down into a warm blue pool. All the other patients there were very old. Here is how we all learned to walk properly again. Underwater. Blue.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Once I fell through\u2014into the dark.</span></p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Braces and casts.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Being told not to write.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Being told not to read.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Forgetting someone I once promised I would never forget.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Remembering her finally, one year, then forgetting her again, the next day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Remembering not remembering I\u2019d forgotten.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Forgetting them completely.</span></p>\n\n<p>*</p>\n\n<p>When I look at photographs of Matisse, unable to walk, drawing on the wall from the bed, his charcoal tied to the end of a very long pole, I stop breathing.</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Him, I think. Yes. I could marry him.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I could slip into his bed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We could talk about real things.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I could be his dark line hovering above.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We could watch the light turning the room every color.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Eve Remembering", "view_node": "/poem/eve-remembering", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/toni-morrison\" hreflang=\"en\">Toni Morrison</a>", "field_date_published": "2002", "body": "<p>1</p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I tore from a limb fruit that had lost its green.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My hands were warmed by the heat of an apple</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fire red and humming.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I bit sweet power to the core.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How can I say what it was like?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The taste!
