/>Who is weary as I am weary of all but death.<br />Toward whom I look as looks the sunflower<br />All day with all his whole soul toward the sun;<br />While in the sun\u2019s sight I make moan all day,<br />And all night on my sleepless maiden bed<br />Weep and call out on death, O Love, and thee,<br />That thou or he would take me to the dead,<br />And know not what thing evil I have done<br />That life should lay such heavy hand on me.<br /><br />Alas, Love, what is this thou wouldst with me?<br />What honour shalt thou have to quench my breath,<br />Or what shall my heart broken profit thee?<br />O Love, O great god Love, what have I done,<br />That thou shouldst hunger so after my death?<br />My heart is harmless as my life\u2019s first day:<br />Seek out some false fair woman, and plague her<br />Till her tears even as my tears fill her bed:<br />I am the least flower in thy flowery way,<br />But till my time be come that I be dead<br />Let me live out my flower-time in the sun<br />Though my leaves shut before the sunflower.<br /><br />O Love, Love, Love, the kingly sunflower!<br />Shall he the sun hath looked on look on me,<br />That live down here in shade, out of the sun,<br />Here living in the sorrow and shadow of death?<br />Shall he that feeds his heart full of the day<br />Care to give mine eyes light, or my lips breath?<br />Because she loves him shall my lord love her<br />Who is as a worm in my lord\u2019s kingly way?<br />I shall not see him or know him alive or dead;<br />But thou, I know thee, O Love, and pray to thee<br />That in brief while my brief life-days be done,<br />And the worm quickly make my marriage-bed.<br /><br />For underground there is no sleepless bed:<br />But here since I beheld my sunflower<br />These eyes have slept not, seeing all night and day<br />His sunlike eyes, and face fronting the sun.<br />Wherefore if anywhere be any death,<br />I would fain find and fold him fast to me,<br />That I may sleep with the world\u2019s eldest dead,<br />With her that died seven centuries since, and her<br />That went last night down the night-wandering way.<br />For this is sleep indeed, when labour is done,<br />Without love, without dreams, and without breath,<br />And without thought, O name unnamed! of thee.<br /><br />Ah, but, forgetting all things, shall I thee?<br />Wilt thou not be as now about my bed<br />There underground as here before the sun?<br />Shall not thy vision vex me alive and dead,<br />Thy moving vision without form or breath?<br />I read long since the bitter tale of her<br />Who read the tale of Launcelot on a day,<br />And died, and had no quiet after death,<br />But was moved ever along a weary way,<br />Lost with her love in the underworld; ah me,<br />O my king, O my lordly sunflower,<br />Would God to me too such a thing were done!<br /><br />But if such sweet and bitter things be done,<br />Then, flying from life, I shall not fly from thee.<br />For in that living world without a sun<br />Thy vision will lay hold upon me dead,<br />And meet and mock me, and mar my peace in death.<br />Yet if being wroth God had such pity on her,<br />Who was a sinner and foolish in her day,<br />That even in hell they twain should breathe one breath,<br />Why should he not in some wise pity me?<br />So if I sleep not in my soft strait bed<br />I may look up and see my sunflower<br />As he the sun, in some divine strange way.<br /><br />O poor my heart, well knowest thou in what way<br />This sore sweet evil unto us was done.<br />For on a holy and a heavy day<br />I was arisen out of my still small bed<br />To see the knights tilt, and one said to me<br />\u201cThe king,\u201d and seeing him, somewhat stopped my breath,<br />And if the girl spake more, I heard not her,<br />For only I saw what I shall see when dead,<br />A kingly flower of knights, a sunflower,<br />That shone against the sunlight like the sun,<br />And like a fire, O heart, consuming thee,<br />The fire of love that lights the pyre of death.<br /><br />Howbeit I shall not die an evil death<br />Who have loved in such a sad and sinless way,<br />That this my love, lord, was no shame to thee.<br />So when mine eyes are shut against the sun,<br />O my soul\u2019s sun, O the world\u2019s sunflower,<br />Thou nor no man will quite despise me dead.<br />And dying I pray with all my low last breath<br />That thy whole life may be as was that day,<br />That feast-day that made trothplight death and me,<br />Giving the world light of thy great deeds done;<br />And that fair face brightening thy bridal bed,<br />That God be good as God hath been to her.<br /><br />That all things goodly and glad remain with her,<br />All things that make glad life and goodly death;<br />That as a bee sucks from a sunflower<br />Honey, when summer draws delighted breath,<br />Her soul may drink of thy soul in like way,<br />And love make life a fruitful marriage-bed<br />Where day may bring forth fruits of joy to day<br />And night to night till days and nights be dead.<br />And as she gives light of her love to thee,<br />Give thou to her the old glory of days long done;<br />And either give some heat of light to me,<br />To warm me where I sleep without the sun.<br /><br />O sunflower made drunken with the sun,<br />O knight whose lady\u2019s heart draws thine to her,<br />Great king, glad lover, I have a word to thee.<br />There is a weed lives out of the sun\u2019s way,<br />Hid from the heat deep in the meadow\u2019s bed,<br />That swoons and whitens at the wind\u2019s least breath,<br />A flower star-shaped, that all a summer day<br />Will gaze her soul out on the sunflower<br />For very love till twilight finds her dead.<br />But the great sunflower heeds not her poor death,<br />Knows not when all her loving life is done;<br />And so much knows my lord the king of me.<br /><br />Aye, all day long he has no eye for me;<br />With golden eye following the golden sun<br />From rose-coloured to purple-pillowed bed,<br />From birthplace to the flame-lit place of death,<br />From eastern end to western of his way.<br />So mine eye follows thee, my sunflower,<br />So the white star-flower turns and yearns to thee,<br />The sick weak weed, not well alive or dead,<br />Trod underfoot if any pass by her,<br />Pale, without colour of summer or summer breath<br />In the shrunk shuddering petals, that have done<br />No work but love, and die before the day.<br /><br />But thou, to-day, to-morrow, and every day,<br />Be glad and great, O love whose love slays me.<br />Thy fervent flower made fruitful from the sun<br />Shall drop its golden seed in the world\u2019s way,<br />That all men thereof nourished shall praise thee<br />For grain and flower and fruit of works well done;</p><p>Till thy shed seed, O shining sunflower,<br />Bring forth such growth of the world\u2019s garden-bed<br />As like the sun shall outlive age and death.<br />And yet I would thine heart had heed of her<br />Who loves thee alive; but not till she be dead.<br />Come, Love, then, quickly, and take her utmost breath.<br /><br />Song, speak for me who am dumb as are the dead;<br />From my sad bed of tears I send forth thee,<br />To fly all day from sun\u2019s birth to sun\u2019s death<br />Down the sun\u2019s way after the flying sun,<br />For love of her that gave thee wings and breath,<br />Ere day be done, to seek the sunflower.</p> "}, {"title": "Crows in a Fresh Mown Field Before Rain", "view_node": "/poem/crows-fresh-mown-field-rain",

flatter, once again attend,\u00a0<br />Hear Lydiat\u2019s life, and Galileo\u2019s end.\u00a0<br />\u00a0Nor deem, when learning her last prize bestows\u00a0<br />The glitt\u2019ring eminence exempt from foes;\u00a0<br />See when the vulgar \u2019scapes despis\u2019d or aw\u2019d,\u00a0<br />Rebellion\u2019s vengeful talons seize on Laud.\u00a0<br />From meaner minds, though smaller fines content,<br />The plunder\u2019d palace, or sequester\u2019d rent;\u00a0<br />Mark\u2019d out by dangerous parts he meets the shock,\u00a0<br />And fatal learning leads him to the block:\u00a0<br />Around his tomb let art and genius weep,\u00a0<br />But hear his death, ye blockheads, hear and sleep.\u00a0<br />\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The festal blazes, the triumphal show,<br />The ravish\u2019d standard, and the captive foe,<br />The senate\u2019s thanks, the Gazette\u2019s pompous tale,<br />With force resistless o\u2019er the brave prevail.<br />Such bribes the rapid Greek o\u2019er Asia whirl\u2019d,<br />For such the steady Romans shook the world;<br />For such in distant lands the Britons shine,<br />And stain with blood the Danube or the Rhine;<br />This power has praise, that virtue scarce can warm,<br />Till fame supplies the universal charm.<br />Yet reason frowns on war\u2019s unequal game,<br />Where wasted nation\u2019s raise a single name,<br />And mortgag\u2019d states their grandsire\u2019s wreaths regret,<br />From age to age in everlasting debt;<br />Wreaths which at last the dear-bought right convey,<br />To rust on medals, or on stones decay.<br />\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0On what foundation stands the warrior\u2019s pride,<br />How just his hopes, let Swedish Charles decide;<br />A frame of adamant, a soul of fire,<br />No dangers fright him, and no labours tire;<br />O\u2019er love, o\u2019er fear, extends his wide domain,<br />Unconquer\u2019d lord of pleasure and of pain;<br />No joys to him pacific scepters yield,<br />War sounds the trump, he rushes to the field;<br />Behold surrounding kings their power combine,<br />And one capitulate, and one resign;<br />Peace courts his hand, but spreads her charms in vain;<br />\u201cThink nothing gain\u2019d,\u201d he cries, \u201ctill nought remain,<br />\u201cOn Muscow\u2019s walls till Gothic standards fly,<br />\u201cAnd all be mine beneath the polar sky.\u201d<br />The march begins in military state,<br />And nations on his eye suspended wait;<br />Stern famine guards the solitary coast,<br />And winter barricades the realms of frost;<br />He comes, nor want nor cold his course delay;<br />Hide, blushing glory, hide Pultowa\u2019s day:<br />The vanquish\u2019d hero leaves his broken bands,<br />And shews his miseries in distant lands;<br />Condemn\u2019d a needy supplicant to wait,<br />While ladies interpose, and slaves debate.<br />But did not chance at length her error mend?<br />Did no subverted empire mark his end?<br />Did rival monarchs give the fatal wound?<br />Or hostile millions press him to the ground?<br />His fall was destin\u2019d to a barren strand,<br />A petty fortress, and a dubious hand;<br />He left the name at which the world grew pale,<br />To point a moral, or adorn a tale.<br />\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0All times their scenes of pompous woes afford,<br />From Persia\u2019s tyrant to Bavaria\u2019s lord,<br />In gay hostility, and barb\u2019rous pride,<br />With half mankind embattled at his side,<br />Great Xerxes comes to seize the certain prey,<br />And starves exhausted regions in his way;<br />Attendant flattery counts his myriads o\u2019er,<br />Till counted myriads sooth his pride no more;<br />Fresh praise is try\u2019d, till madness fires his mind,<br />The waves he lashes, and enchains the wind;<br />New pow\u2019rs are claim\u2019d, new pow\u2019rs are still bestow\u2019d,<br />Till rude resistance lops the spreading god;<br />The daring Greeks deride the marital show,<br />And heap their valleys with the gaudy foe;<br />Th\u2019 insulted sea with humbler thoughts he gains,<br />A single skiff to speed his flight remains:<br />Th\u2019 encumber\u2019d oar scarce leaves the dreaded coast<br />Through purple billows and a floating host.<br />\u00a0\u00a0 The bold Bavarian, in a luckless hour,<br />Tries the dread summits of Caesarean power,<br />With unexpected legions bursts away,<br />And sees defenceless realms receive his sway;<br />Short sway! fair Austria spreads her mournful charms,<br />The queen, the beauty, sets the world in arms;<br />From hill to hill the beacon\u2019s rousing blaze<br />Spreads wide the hope of plunder and of praise.<br />The fierce Croatian, and the wild Hussar,<br />With all the sons of ravage crowd the war;<br />The baffled prince in honour\u2019s flattering bloom<br />Of hasty greatness finds the fatal doom;<br />His foes\u2019 derision, and his subjects\u2019 blame,<br />And steals to death from anguish and from shame.<br />\u00a0Enlarge my life with multitude of days,\u00a0<br />In health, in sickness, thus the suppliant prays;\u00a0<br />Hides from himself his state, and shuns to know<br />That life protracted is protracted woe.\u00a0<br />Time hovers o\u2019er, impatient to destroy,\u00a0<br />And shuts up all the passages of joy:\u00a0<br />In vain their gifts the bounteous seasons pour,\u00a0<br />The fruit autumnal, and the vernal flower,\u00a0<br />With listless eyes the dotard views the store,\u00a0<br />He views, and wonders that they please no more;\u00a0<br />Now pall the tasteless meats, and joyless wines,\u00a0<br />And luxury with sighs her slave resigns.\u00a0<br />Approach, ye minstrels, try the soothing strain,\u00a0<br />And yield the tuneful lenitives of pain:\u00a0<br />No sounds, alas! would touch th\u2019 impervious ear,\u00a0<br />Though dancing mountains witness\u2019d Orpheus near;\u00a0<br />Nor lute nor lyre his feeble pow\u2019rs attend,\u00a0<br />Nor sweeter music of a virtuous friend,\u00a0<br />But everlasting dictates crowd his tongue,\u00a0<br />Perversely grave, or positively wrong.\u00a0<br />The still returning tale, and ling\u2019ring jest,\u00a0<br />Perplex the fawning niece and pamper\u2019d guest;<br />While growing hopes scarce awe the gathering sneer,\u00a0<br />And scarce a legacy can bribe to hear;\u00a0<br />The watchful guests still hint the last offence,\u00a0<br />The daughter\u2019s petulance, the son\u2019s expence,\u00a0<br />Improve his heady rage with treach\u2019rous skill,\u00a0<br />And mould his passions till they make his will.\u00a0<br />\u00a0Unnumber\u2019d maladies his joints invade,\u00a0<br />Lay siege to life and press the dire blockade;\u00a0<br />But unextinguish\u2019d Av\u2019rice still remains,\u00a0<br />And dreaded losses aggravate his pains;\u00a0<br />He turns, with anxious heart and crippled hands,\u00a0<br />His bonds of debt, and mortgages of lands;\u00a0<br />Or views his coffers with suspicious eyes,\u00a0<br />Unlocks his gold, and counts it till he dies.\u00a0<br />\u00a0But grant, the virtues of a temp\u2019rate prime\u00a0<br />Bless with an age exempt from scorn or crime;\u00a0<br />An age that melts with unperceiv\u2019d decay,\u00a0<br />And glides in modest innocence away;\u00a0<br />Whose peaceful day benevolence endears,\u00a0<br />Whose night congratulating conscience cheers;\u00a0<br />The gen\u2019ral fav\u2019rite as the gen\u2019ral friend:\u00a0<br />Such age there is, and who could wish its end?\u00a0<br />\u00a0Yet ev\u2019n on this her load misfortune flings,\u00a0<br />To press the weary minutes\u2019 flagging wings:\u00a0<br />New sorrow rises as the day returns,\u00a0<br />A sister sickens, or a daughter mourns.\u00a0<br />Now kindred merit fills the sable bier,\u00a0<br />Now lacerated friendship claims a tear.\u00a0<br />Year chases year, decay pursues decay,\u00a0<br />Still drops some joy from with\u2019ring life away;\u00a0<br />New forms arise, and diff\u2019rent views engage,\u00a0<br />Superfluous lags the vet\u2019ran on the stage,\u00a0<br />Till pitying nature signs the last release,\u00a0<br />And bids afflicted worth retire to peace.\u00a0<br />\u00a0But few there are whom hours like these await,\u00a0<br />Who set unclouded in the gulfs of fate.\u00a0<br />From Lydia\u2019s monarch should the search descend,\u00a0<br />By Solon caution\u2019d to regard his end,\u00a0<br />In life\u2019s last scene what prodigies surprise,\u00a0<br />Fears of the brave, and follies of the wise?\u00a0<br />From Marlb\u2019rough\u2019s eyes the streams of dotage flow,\u00a0<br />And Swift expires a driv\u2019ler and a show.\u00a0<br />\u00a0The teeming mother, anxious for her race,\u00a0<br />Begs for each birth the fortune of a face:\u00a0<br />Yet Vane could tell what ills from beauty spring;\u00a0<br />And Sedley curs\u2019d the form that pleas\u2019d a king.\u00a0<br />Ye nymphs of rosy lips and radiant eyes,\u00a0<br />Whom Pleasure keeps too busy to be wise,\u00a0<br />Whom Joys with soft varieties invite,\u00a0<br />By day the frolic, and the dance by night,\u00a0<br />Who frown with vanity, who smile with art,\u00a0<br />And ask the latest fashion of the heart,\u00a0<br />What care, what rules your heedless charms shall save,\u00a0<br />Each nymph your rival, and each youth your slave?\u00a0<br />Against your fame with fondness hate combines,\u00a0<br />The rival batters, and the lover mines.\u00a0<br />With distant voice neglected virtue calls,\u00a0<br />Less heard and less, the faint remonstrance falls;\u00a0<br />Tir\u2019d with contempt, she quits the slipp\u2019ry reign,\u00a0<br />And pride and prudence take her seat in vain.\u00a0<br />In crowd at once, where none the pass defend,\u00a0<br />The harmless freedom, and the private friend.\u00a0<br />The guardians yield, by force superior plied;\u00a0<br />To int\u2019rest, prudence; and by flatt\u2019ry, pride.\u00a0<br />Here beauty falls betray\u2019d, despis\u2019d, distress\u2019d,\u00a0<br />And hissing infamy proclaims the rest.\u00a0<br />\u00a0Where then shall hope and fear their objects find?\u00a0<br />Must dull suspense corrupt the stagnant mind?\u00a0<br />Must helpless man, in ignorance sedate,\u00a0<br />Roll darkling down the torrent of his fate?\u00a0<br />Must no dislike alarm, no wishes rise,\u00a0<br />No cries attempt the mercies of the skies?\u00a0<br />Inquirer, cease, petitions yet remain,\u00a0<br />Which heaven may hear, nor deem religion vain.\u00a0<br />Still raise for good the supplicating voice,\u00a0<br />But leave to heaven the measure and the choice.\u00a0<br />Safe in his pow\u2019r, whose eyes discern afar\u00a0<br />The secret ambush of a specious pray\u2019r.\u00a0<br />Implore his aid, in his decisions rest,\u00a0<br />Secure whate\u2019er he gives, he gives the best.\u00a0<br />Yet when the sense of sacred presence fires,\u00a0<br />And strong devotion to the skies aspires,\u00a0<br />Pour forth thy fervors for a healthful mind,\u00a0<br />Obedient passions, and a will resign\u2019d;\u00a0<br />For love, which scarce collective man can fill;\u00a0<br />For patience, sov\u2019reign o\u2019er transmuted ill;\u00a0<br />For faith, that panting for a happier seat,\u00a0<br />Counts death kind nature\u2019s signal of retreat:\u00a0<br />These goods for man the laws of heaven ordain,\u00a0<br />These goods he grants, who grants the pow\u2019r to gain;\u00a0<br />With these celestial wisdom calms the mind,\u00a0<br
