Who will walk<br />Between me and the crying of the frogs?<br />Oh, savage Beauty, suffer me to pass,<br />That am a timid woman, on her way<br />From one house to another!</p><p>\u00a0</p> "}, {"title": "The Life of Trees ", "view_node": "/poem/life-trees", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/dorianne-laux\" hreflang=\"und\">Dorianne Laux</a>", "field_date_published": "2009", "body": "<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">The pines rub their great noise</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into the spangled dark, scratch</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">their itchy boughs against the house,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that moan\u2019s mystery translates roughly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into drudgery of ownership: time</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to drag the ladder from the shed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">climb onto the roof with a saw</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">between my teeth, cut</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">those suckers down. What's reality</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">if not a long exhaustive cringe</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from the blade, the teeth. I want to sleep</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and dream the life of trees, beings</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from the muted world who care</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">nothing for Money, Politics, Power,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Will or Right, who want little from the night</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but a few dead stars going dim, a white owl</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">lifting from their limbs, who want only</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to sink their roots into the wet ground</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and terrify the worms or shake</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">their bleary heads like fashion models</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or old hippies. If trees could speak,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they wouldn't, only hum some low</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">green note, roll their pinecones</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">down the empty streets and blame it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with a shrug, on the cold wind.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">During the day they sleep inside</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">their furry bark, clouds shredding</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like ancient lace above their crowns.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sun. Rain. Snow. Wind. They fear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">nothing but the Hurricane, and Fire,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that whipped bully who rises up</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and becomes his own dead father.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the storms the young ones</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">bend and bend and the old know</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they may not make it, go down</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with the power lines sparking,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">broken at the trunk. They fling</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">their branches, forked sacrifice</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to the beaten earth. They do not pray.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If they make a sound it's eaten</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">by the wind. And though the stars</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">return they do not offer thanks, only</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">ooze a sticky sap from their roundish</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">concentric wounds, clap the water</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from their needles, straighten their spines</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and breathe, and breathe again.</span></p>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 522, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
