Her feet<br />were bare and the earth cool while a loose hem<br />feathered her ankles for her walk. Bracing on<br />stems for the gradual pace to not disturb all the<br />sleeping turtles, she wished for sunlight in a<br />shade of green to hurry growth and to keep her<br />hidden. How close could she lean into the<br />memory of relatives who lived this life of damp<br />shells and slow demeanor without alerting them<br />of her intent. All of grandma\u2019s voices were now<br />shaking her sleepy mind and begging her return<br />to answer the details of her dream. It was the<br />call of tradition that signaled the next step to<br />seal the new experience into her life basket.<br />She will be served turtle's energy for her growth.<br />Off of grandma's favorite tree a knot was cut and<br />shaped into a bowl. Handles in the shape of<br />young turtles were carved into the sides. Into<br />the cottonwood bowl was poured the prepared<br />soup with essence of memory from a life once<br />lived. Thanking all that came before this earth<br />life, was her detailed prayer. A calling of all<br />water animals to witness the taking of one<br />energy to give to the energy of another, a child<br />who passed the test of recalling ancient blood.<br />Her heart will live with turtle strength. Her<br />life will be long and purposefully directed. Her<br />song will be like the cool breeze moving tall<br />willows above eddies remembering motion.</p> "}, {"title": "Only Bread, Only Light", "view_node": "/poem/only-bread-only-light", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/stephen-kuusisto\" hreflang=\"en\">Stephen Kuusisto</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <p>At times the blind see light,<br />And that moment is the Sistine ceiling,</p><p>Grace among buildings\u2014no one asks<br />For it, no one asks.</p><p>After all, this is solitude,<br />Daylight\u2019s finger,</p><p>Blake\u2019s angel<br />Parting willow leaves.</p><p>I should know better.<br />Get with the business</p><p>Of walking the lovely, satisfied,<br />Indifferent weather\u2014</p><p>Bread baking<br />On Arthur Avenue</p><p>This first warm day of June.<br />I stand on the corner</p><p>For priceless seconds.<br />Now everything to me falls shadow.</p> "}, {"title": "Learning Braille at Thirty-Nine", "view_node": "/poem/learning-braille-thirty-nine", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/stephen-kuusisto\" hreflang=\"en\">Stephen Kuusisto</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <p>The dry universe<br />Gives up its fruit,</p><p>Black seeds are raining,<br />Pascal dreams of a wristwatch,</p><p>And heaven help me<br />The metempsychosis of book</p><p>Is upon me.

May I be abandoned to ice\n\nand gasoline, to jasmine flowers and chicken bones \nand the white laughter\nof children, surrendered to the rain\nand the stammer of a cloud\u00ad-fathered voice rattling \nthe branches of the sumac tree secure\nin its nest of silence. In the middle of the bombed marketplace \na mustard seed and inside that mustard seed\na prayer. All the pages of the heart\u2019s book torn out\nand given to the wind. You say they are lost.\nBut I tell you that is the only way they could have been saved.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Hallowmas", "view_node": "/poem/hallowmas", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/madison-julius-cawein\" hreflang=\"und\">Madison Julius Cawein</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <div>All hushed of glee,</div><div>The last chill bee</div><div>Clings wearily</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0To the dying aster:</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The leaves drop faster:</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And all around, red as disaster,</div><div>The forest crimsons with tree on tree.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>A butterfly,</div><div>The last to die,</div><div>Droops heavily by,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Weighed down with torpor:</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The air grows sharper:</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And the wind in the trees, like some sad harper,</div><div>Sits and sorrows with sigh on sigh.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The far crows call;</div><div>The acorns fall;</div><div>And over all</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The Autumn raises</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Dun mists and hazes,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Through which her soul, it seemeth, gazes</div><div>On ghosts and dreams in carnival.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The end is near:</div><div>The dying Year</div><div>Leans low to hear</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Her own heart breaking,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And Beauty taking</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Her flight, and all her dreams forsaking</div><div>Her soul, bowed down 'mid the sad and sere.</div><div>\u00a0</div> "}, {"title": "Halloween", "view_node": "/poem/halloween-2", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/madison-julius-cawein\" hreflang=\"und\">Madison Julius Cawein</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <div>It was down in the woodland on last Hallowe'en,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Where silence and darkness had built them a lair,</div><div>That I felt the dim presence of her, the unseen,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And heard her still step on the hush-haunted air.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>It was last Hallowe'en in the glimmer and swoon</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Of mist and of moonlight, where once we had sinned,</div><div>That I saw the gray gleam of her eyes in the moon,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And hair, like a raven, blown wild on the wind.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>It was last Hallowe'en where starlight and dew</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Made mystical marriage on flower and leaf,</div><div>That she led me with looks of a love, that I knew</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Was dead, and the voice of a passion too brief.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>It was last Hallowe'en in the forest of dreams,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Where trees are eidolons and flowers have eyes,</div><div>That I saw her pale face like the foam of far streams,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And heard, like the night-wind, her tears and her sighs.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>It was last Hallowe'en, the haunted, the dread,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0In the wind-tattered wood, by the storm-twisted pine,</div><div>That I, who am living, kept tryst with the dead,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And clasped her a moment who once had been mine.</div><div>\u00a0</div> "}, {"title": "October-November", "view_node": "/poem/october-november", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/hart-crane\" hreflang=\"und\">Hart Crane</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <div>Indian-summer-sun</div><div>With crimson feathers whips away the mists,\u2014</div><div>Dives through the filter of trellises</div><div>And gilds the silver on the blotched arbor-seats.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Now gold and purple scintillate</div><div>On trees that seem dancing</div><div>In delirium;</div><div>Then the moon</div><div>In a mad orange flare\u00a0</div><div>Floods the grape-hung night.</div><div>\u00a0</div> "}, {"title": "Numinous", "view_node": "/poem/numinous", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/alex-manley\" hreflang=\"en\">Alex Manley</a>", "field_date_published": "2017", "body": " <div>When the pantheon crumbles, does gravity still work?\u00a0</div><div>What happens to the arcing satellites?
