And so I dare to hope,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I came among these hills; when like a roe</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wherever nature led: more like a man</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flying from something that he dreads, than one</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And their glad animal movements all gone by)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To me was all in all.\u2014I cannot paint</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What then I was. The sounding cataract</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their colours and their forms, were then to me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">An appetite; a feeling and a love,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That had no need of a remoter charm,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By thought supplied, nor any interest</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unborrowed from the eye.\u2014That time is past,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And all its aching joys are now no more,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Abundant recompence. For I have learned</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To look on nature, not as in the hour</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The still, sad music of humanity,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To chasten and subdue. And I have felt</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A presence that disturbs me with the joy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of something far more deeply interfused,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the round ocean and the living air,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A motion and a spirit, that impels</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And rolls through all things.
