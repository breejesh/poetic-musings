It didn\u2019t look</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     like he was going to make it, and then he made it. I\u2019m watching him</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     now from my window as he makes his slow way across his yard </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">     with some tree branches that fell in last night\u2019s storm. Three steps.</span>  \n<span class=\"long-line\">     Wait. Three steps. It\u2019s a hard slog. Watching, I want to pitch in.</span>  \n<span class=\"long-line\">     And we do, at such times, wanting to help. But on the other hand,</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     it\u2019s good to be as physical as possible in recovery. Maybe this is part</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     of his rehab. Maybe this is doctor\u2019s orders: DO YARDWORK.</span>  \n<span class=\"long-line\">     And here comes his wife across the yard anyway, to give a hand </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">     with a large branch. She\u2019s able to quickly overtake him, and she folds </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">     into the process smoothly, no words between them that I can make out. </span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     It\u2019s another part of what makes us human, weighing the theory of mind,</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     watching each other struggle or perform, anticipating each other\u2019s</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     thoughts, as the abject hovers uncannily in the background, threatening</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     to break through the fragile borders of the self. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like to be</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     a bat?\u201d we ask. The bats don\u2019t respond. How usually, our lives</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     unfold at the periphery of catastrophes happening to others. I\u2019m</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     reading, while my neighbor struggles, that the squirrel population</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     in New England is in the midst of an unprecedented boom. A recent</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     abundance of acorns is the reason for this surge in squirrel populations,</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     most particularly in New Hampshire. They\u2019re everywhere, being</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     squirrely, squirreling acorns away. We call it \u201cSquirrelnado\u201d because </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">     it\u2019s all around us, circling, and dangerous, and kind of funny. Language </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">     springs from the land, and through our imagination we become </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">     human. They\u2019re back in the house now. We name the things we see,</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     or they name themselves into our experience, whichever, and then </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">     we use those names for things we don\u2019t understand, what we can\u2019t</span> \n<span class=\"long-line\">     express. Wind becomes spirit becomes ghost. Mountain becomes </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">     god. The land springs up before us. It shakes us and pushes us over.  </span>\n</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 174, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
