We tend to</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">our flowers in the meantime. And in the meantime, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a daughter is born. She begins as a mere inch, lost</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the folds of a sheet; it's horror to lose her before</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">she's yet born. Night nurses embody the darkness.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only your brain remains, floating in a jar that sits </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in a lab far off, some place away, and terribly far.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Your skull no longer exists, its ash has been lifted</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to wind from a mountain's top by brothers, friends. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am no friend. According to them. Accordion, the</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">child pulls its witching wind between its opposite</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">handles: the lungs of the thing grieve, and that is</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">its noise. She writhes the floor in tantrum. When</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">you climbed the sides of the house spider-wise to</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">let yourself in, unlocked the front door, let me in</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to climb up into your attic the last time I saw you</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that infected cat rubbed its face against my hand.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wanting to keep it. <em>No</em>, you said. We are friends.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I wear my green jacket with the furred hood. You </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pushed me against chain-length. Today is the day </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that the planet circles the night we began. A child </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is born. Night nurses coagulate her glassed-in crib.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Your organs, distant, still float the darkness of jars.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Autumn", "view_node": "/poem/autumn-2", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/amy-lowell\" hreflang=\"und\">Amy Lowell</a>", "field_date_published": "1919", "body": " <pre>\nThey brought me a quilled, yellow dahlia,\nOpulent, flaunting.\nRound gold\nFlung out of a pale green stalk.\nRound, ripe gold\nOf maturity,\nMeticulously frilled and flaming,\nA fire-ball of proclamation:\nFecundity decked in staring yellow\nFor all the world to see.\nThey brought a quilled, yellow dahlia,\nTo me who am barren\nShall I send it to you,\nYou who have taken with you\nAll I once possessed?</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Coming to That", "view_node": "/poem/coming", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/dorothea-tanning\" hreflang=\"und\">Dorothea Tanning</a>", "field_date_published": "2011", "body": " <pre>\n\"If it comes to that,\" he said, \"there'll be no\npreventing it.\"\nHe uttered it as I listened.
