Its missing wings, like stumps; \nIts breasts and claws mutilated by time; \nThe hollows where its vanished nose and hair \nOnce curled are now home \nTo the obscene birds feeding \nOn desolation, on death. \n\nWhen moonlight touches \nThe Chimera, it seems to come alive with a sob, \nA moan that rises not from the ruin \nBut from the centuries rooted inside it, immortally \nCrying over not being able to die, as the forms \nThat man gives life to always die. Dying is hard, \nBut not being able to die, if everything dies, \nIs perhaps harder still. The Chimera murmurs at the moon \nAnd its voice is so sweet it eases its desolation. \n\n\"No victims, no lovers. Where did the people go? \nThey no longer believe in me, and the unanswerable riddles \nI posed, like the Sphinx, my rival and sister, \nNo longer tempt them. The divine survives, \nIn all its protean forms, even though the gods die. \nThat's why this deathless desire is alive in me, \nThough my form is wasted, though I'm less than a shade; \nA desire to see humanity humbled \nIn fear before me, before my tempting indecipherable secret.\n \n\"Man is like an animal tamed \nBy the whip. But how beautiful; his strength and his beauty, \nOh gods, how captivating. There is delight in man; \nWhen man is beautiful, how delightful he is. \nCenturies have passed since man deserted \nMe and disdainfully forgot my secrets. \nAnd while a few still pay me some attention, \nI find no enchantment among the poets, \nAs my secret scarcely tempts them and I see in them no beauty. \n\n\"Skinny, flaccid, balding, bespectacled, \nToothless. That's the physical aspect \nOf my former servant; and his character \nLooks the same. Even so, not many seek my secret now, \nSince they find in woman their personal sad Chimera. \nAnd it's just as well I'm forgotten, because anyone \nChanging infants' diapers and wiping noses while he thinks \nAbout some critic's praise or bad review \nHas no time to pay me any attention. \n\n\"Can they really believe in being poets \nIf they no longer have the power, the madness \nTo believe in me and my secret? \nBetter for them an academic chair \nThan barrenness, ruin and death, \nThe generous recompense I gave my victims, \nOnce I had possession of their souls, \nWhen men and poets still preferred \nA cruel mirage to bourgeois certainty. \n\n\"Clearly for me those times were different \nWhen with a light heart I danced happily through the labyrinth \nWhere I lost so many and so many others I endowed \nWith my eternal madness: joyful imagination, dreams of the future, \nHopes of love, sunny voyages. \nBut the prudent ones, the cautious men, I strangled \nWith my powerful claws, since a grain of madness \nIs the salt of life. Now that I've been and gone, \nI don't have any more promises for man.\" \n\nThe moon's reflection sliding \nOver the deaf sand of the desert \nLeaves the Chimera stranded among shadows, \nThe captive music of its sweet voice quieted. \nAnd as the sea pulls back the tide \nLeaving the beach denuded of its magic, \nThe voice's spell, pulled back, leaves the desert \nEven more unwelcoming, its dunes \nBlind, dulled without the old mirage. \n\nMute, in darkness, the Chimera seems to have retreated \nInto the ancestral night of primal Chaos; \nBut neither gods, nor men, nor their creations \nAre ever nullified once they've been; they must exist \nUntil the bitter end, disappearing into the dust. \nImmobile, sad, the noseless Chimera can smell \nThe freshness of dawn, dawn of another day \nWhen death will not have pity on it, \nBut its desolate existence will continue.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "from Nox [gentes]", "view_node": "/poem/nox-gentes", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/anne-carson\" hreflang=\"und\">Anne Carson</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": "<p><br /><img alt=\"from Nox [&quot;gentes, gens gentis, feminine noun...]\" data-entity-type=\"file\" data-entity-uuid=\"bda2dbec-ff51-49c1-a3b6-b1e2bd06f223\" height=\"359\" src=\"/sites/default/files/inline-images/Nox_1_4.png\" width=\"463\" /></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n"}, {"title": "The Apple Trees at Olema", "view_node": "/poem/apple-trees-olema", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/robert-hass\" hreflang=\"und\">Robert Hass</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>\nThey are walking in the woods along the coast\nand in a grassy meadow, wasting, they come upon\ntwo old neglected apple trees.

His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.

It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns.

For her own person,\nIt beggar'd all description: she did lie\nIn her pavilion, cloth-of-gold of tissue,\nO'erpicturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature: on each side her\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\nWith divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\nAnd what they undid did.\n\n<i>Agrippa</i>: O, rare for Antony.\n\n<i>Enobarbus</i>: Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,\nSo many mermaids, tended her i' th' eyes,\nAnd made their bends adornings. At the helm\nA seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle\nSwell with the touches of those flower-soft hands\nThat yarely frame the office. From the barge\nA strange invisible perfume hits the sense\nOf the adjacent wharfs. The city cast\nHer people out upon her; and Antony,\nEnthroned i' th' marketplace, did sit alone,\nWhistling to th' air; which, but for vacancy,\nHad gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,\nAnd made a gap in nature.\n\n<i>Agrippa</i>: Rare Egyptian!\n\n<i>Enobarbus</i>: Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,\nInvited her to supper. She replied\nIt should be better he became her guest;\nWhich she entreated. Our courteous Antony,\nWhom ne'er the word of \"No\" woman heard speak,\nBeing barbered ten times o'er, goes to the feast,\nAnd for his ordinary, pays his heart\nFor what his eyes eat only.\n\n<i>Agrippa</i>: Royal wench!\nShe made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;\nHe plowed her, and she cropped.\n\n<i>Enobarbus</i>: I saw her once\nHop forty paces through the public street;\nAnd having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,\nThat she did make defect perfection,\nAnd, breathless, pow'r breathe forth.\n\n<i>Maecenas</i>: Now Antony must leave her utterly.\n\n<i>Enobarbus</i>: Never; He will not:\nAge cannot wither her, nor custom stale\nHer infinite variety. Other women cloy\nThe appetites they feed, but she makes hungry\nWhere most she satisfies; for vilest things\nBecome themselves in her, that the holy priests\nBless her when she is riggish.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Canterbury Tales,  Wife of Bath&#039;s Prologue [Excerpt]", "view_node": "/poem/canterbury-tales-wife-baths-prologue-excerpt", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/geoffrey-chaucer\" hreflang=\"und\">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>", "field_date_published": "1478", "body": " <pre>\n     But now, sire,\u2014lat me se\u2014what I shal seyn?\nA ha! by God, I have my tale ageyn.\n     Whan that my fourthe housbonde was on beere,\nI weep algate, and made sory cheere,\nAs wyves mooten, for it is usage,\nAnd with my coverchief covered my visage;\nBut for that I was purveyed of a make,\nI wepte but smal, and that I undertake!\n     To chirche was myn housbonde born a morwe\nWith neighebores, that for hym maden sorwe,\nAnd Jankyn, oure clerk, was oon of tho.\nAs help me God, whan that I saugh hym go\nAfter the beere, me thoughte he hadde a paire\nOf legges and of feet so clene and faire\nThat al myn herte I gaf unto his hoold.\nHe was, I trowe, a twenty wynter oold,\nAnd I was fourty, if I shal seye sooth;\nBut yet I hadde alwey a coltes tooth.\nGat-tothed I was, and that bicam me weel,\nI hadde the prente of se\u00efnte Venus seel.\nAs help me God, I was a lusty oon,\nAnd faire and riche, and yong, and wel bigon,\nAnd trewely, as myne housbondes tolde me,\nI hadde the beste quonyam myghte be.\nFor certes, I am al Venerien\nIn feelynge, and myn herte is Marcien;\nVenus me gaf my lust, my likerousnesse,\nAnd Mars gaf me my sturdy hardynesse.\nMyn \u00e1scendent was Taur, and Mars therinne;\nAllas, allas! that evere love was synne!\nI folwed ay myn inclinacioun\nBy vertu of my constellacioun,\nThat made me I koude noght withdrawe\nMy chambre of Venus from a good felawe.\nYet have I Martes mark upon my face,\nAnd also in another, privee, place.\nFor God so wys be my savacioun,\nI ne loved nevere by no discrecioun,\nBut evere folwede myn appetit,\u2014\nAl were he short, or long, or blak, or whit;\nI took no kep, so that he liked me,\nHow poore he was, ne eek of what degree.</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 503, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
