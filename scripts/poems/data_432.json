we would have turkey,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as well as pork.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><strong>V.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><em>Abuelita</em>\u00a0prepared the poor fowl</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as if committing an act of treason,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">faking her enthusiasm for my sake.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><em>Mam\u00e0</em>\u00a0set a frozen pumpkin pie in the oven</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and prepared candied yams following instructions</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I translated from the marshmallow bag.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The table was arrayed with gladiolus,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the plattered turkey loomed at the center</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on plastic silver from Woolworths.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Everyone sat in green velvet chairs</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">we had upholstered with clear vinyl,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">except T\u00edo Carlos and Toti, seated</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the folding chairs from the Salvation Army.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I uttered a bilingual blessing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and the turkey was passed around</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like a game of Russian Roulette.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"DRY,\" T\u00edo Berto complained, and proceeded</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to drown the lean slices with pork fat drippings</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and cranberry jelly\u2014\"<em>esa mierda roja</em>,\" he called it.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Faces fell when\u00a0<em>Mam\u00e1</em>\u00a0presented her ochre pie\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pumpkin was a home remedy for ulcers, not a dessert.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">T\u00eda Mar\u00eda made three rounds of Cuban coffee</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">then\u00a0<em>Abuelo</em>\u00a0and Pepe cleared the living room furniture,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">put on a Celia Cruz LP and the entire family</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">began to\u00a0<em>merengue</em>\u00a0over the linoleum of our apartment,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sweating rum and coffee until they remembered\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">it was 1970 and 46 degrees\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in\u00a0<em>Am\u00e9rica</em>.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After repositioning the furniture,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">an appropriate darkness filled the room.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">T\u00edo Berto was the last to leave.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Obscurity and Selfhood", "view_node": "/poem/obscurity-and-selfhood", "field_author": "<a
