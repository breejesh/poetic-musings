breed.\n\nNot his to shun the stubborn fight,\n    The struggle against cruel odds.\nAlone, unaided\u2014'tis a sight\n                For men and gods.\n\nAnd now his back is bowed and bent,\n    Now stooping, now erect he stands,\nAnd now the red life blood is sprent\n                From both his hands.\n\nHe takes his enemies on trust\n    As one who sees and yet is blind,\nFor every mutilating thrust\n                Comes from behind.\n\n\u2019Tis done! The dying sun has gone,\n    But triumph fills the soldier\u2019s breast.\n<em>He\u2019s sewn his back brace button on\n                While fully dressed.</em>\n</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 205, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
