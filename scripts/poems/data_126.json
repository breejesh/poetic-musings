star movement is named for seasonal migrations of deer, wolf, hummingbird, dolphin, and as animals stars walk among us. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Our snake Olivia, for example, tells me there\u2019s no conflict between humans and rain, because resource is all around us. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A coyote loved night, and he loved to gaze at the stars.</span></p>\n<p>\u201cI noticed one star in Cassiopeia; I talked to her, and each night she grew brighter and closer, and she came to life here, as a corn snake, my friend.\u201d </p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cShe looks like a dancer on tiptoe, stepping around pink star-blossoms surging up after rain.\u201d</span></p>\n<p>\n3 </p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Constellations are experienced emotionally as this play of self through plant and animal symbols and values. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A dream atmosphere flows; everything represented is sacred; being moves in accord, not of time. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Returning from the Milky Way, she realized crystals had fallen from her bag and looked up. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">My story links a journey to sky with the creation of stars, in which place accommodates becoming. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Chama River flows north-south to the horizon, then straight up through the Milky Way, like water moving\u00a0beneath a riverbed that\u2019s dry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Abiquiu Mountain, El Rito Creek, coyote, snake, rainbow and rain, spider and hummingbird identify equivalent spiritual placements above, so wherever we go, there is company, nurture, from every star in our regard.</span></p>\n<p>\n4 </p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I start up to ask my birds to return home, and find our land continuous with a starry sky mapped as entities who set into motion occurrence, here. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Place awaits an imprint from this potential, even though starlight arriving now already happened; what happens is a depth of field, before and after drought, fire, storm disruption. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I move at high speed, but I\u2019m still standing beside my house in the dark.\u00a0 </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">To go there, I find the place on our mesa that correlates to their tree in the sky and leap up. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Space stirs as star trilliums emerge through darkness like humus. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I ask one blossom to please in the future renew these bonds between sky and my children, so they will always hold light in the minerals of their eyes.</span></p>\n<p>\n5 </p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Sun on its nightly underground journey weaves a black thread between white days on the cosmic loom, cord or resonance between new experience and meaning. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The origin of stars expresses the underlying warp of this fabric; summer solstice draws a diagonal across my floor, precession, weaving ground of informing spirit, so therefore, life is fundamental to stars. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The reverse is well known. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">That\u2019s why I don\u2019t use a telescope, star charts or glasses when I go out; I think of a place; I wait, then fly to my children. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">When the star-gate is raised, there\u2019s a narrow door between sky and ground. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But when I arrive, I find the sky solid; I can\u2019t break through to visit my starbirds and stand there wondering, before dawn. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then sky vault lifts; maybe I can slip through to find the Milky Way and see its blossoms. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then our sun appears in the crack and pushes through to the day.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It\u2019s so bright, so hot, I step back and cover my eyes;
