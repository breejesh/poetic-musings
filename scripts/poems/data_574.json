I explain this possibility to the garbage men. I\u2019m trying to make friends with them, unable to understand why they leave our empty cans in the middle of the driveway, then laugh as they walk away. One says, \u201cAnother name for moving air is wind, and shade is just a very large shadow\u201d\u2014perhaps a nice way to make me feel less eclipsed. It\u2019s not working, it\u2019s not working. I\u2019m scared for children yet to be abducted, scared for the pregnant woman raped at knife point on the New Jersey Turnpike, scared for what violence does to one\u2019s life, how it squats inside the hollow heart like a dead cricket. My son and his friends found a dead cricket, coffined it in a plastic Easter egg and buried it in the backyard.

There are things I don\u2019t want to tell you. How lonely I am today and sick at heart. How the rain falls steadily and cold on a garden grown greener, more lush and even less tame. I haven\u2019t done much, I confess, to contain it. The grapevine, as usual, threatens everything in its path, while the raspberry canes, aggressive and abundant, are clearly out of control. I\u2019m afraid the wildflowers have taken over, being after all the most hardy and tolerant of shade and neglect. This year the violets and lilies of the valley are rampant, while the phlox are about to emit their shocking pink perfume. Oh, my dear, had you been here this spring, you would have seen how the bleeding hearts are thriving.</p> "}], "pager": {"current_page": 574, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
