It doesn\u2019t see him often\nOf late years, though he keeps the old homestead\nAnd sends the children down there with their mother\nTo run wild in the summer\u2014a little wild.\nSometimes he joins them for a day or two\nAnd sees old friends he somehow can\u2019t get near.\nThey meet him in the general store at night,\nPre-occupied with formidable mail,\nRifling a printed letter as he talks.\nThey seem afraid. He wouldn\u2019t have it so:\nThough a great scholar, he\u2019s a democrat,\nIf not at heart, at least on principle.\nLately when coming up to Lancaster\nHis train being late he missed another train\nAnd had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction\nAfter eleven o\u2019clock at night. Too tired\nTo think of sitting such an ordeal out,\nHe turned to the hotel to find a bed.\n\n\u201cNo room,\u201d the night clerk said. \u201cUnless\u2014\u2014\u201d\nWoodsville\u2019s a place of shrieks and wandering lamps\nAnd cars that shook and rattle\u2014and one hotel.\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018unless.\u2019\u201c\n\n\u201cUnless you wouldn\u2019t mind\nSharing a room with someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cA man.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I should hope.

I\u2019m not afraid of him.\nI\u2019m not so drunk I can\u2019t take care of myself.\u201d\n\nThe night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot.\n\u201cThis will be yours. Good-night,\u201d he said, and went.\n\n\u201cLafe was the name, I think?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Layfayette.\nYou got it the first time.

A brute. Naked above the waist,\nHe sat there creased and shining in the light,\nFumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt.\n\u201cI\u2019m moving into a size-larger shirt.\nI\u2019ve felt mean lately; mean\u2019s no name for it.\nI just found what the matter was to-night:\nI\u2019ve been a-choking like a nursery tree\nWhen it outgrows the wire band of its name tag.\nI blamed it on the hot spell we\u2019ve been having.\n\u2019Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back,\nNot liking to own up I\u2019d grown a size.\nNumber eighteen this is. What size do you wear?\u201d\n\nThe Doctor caught his throat convulsively.\n\u201cOh\u2014ah\u2014fourteen\u2014fourteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFourteen! You say so!\nI can remember when I wore fourteen.\nAnd come to think I must have back at home\nMore than a hundred collars, size fourteen.\nToo bad to waste them all. You ought to have them.\nThey\u2019re yours and welcome; let me send them to you.\nWhat makes you stand there on one leg like that?\nYou\u2019re not much furtherer than where Kike left you.\nYou act as if you wished you hadn\u2019t come.\nSit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous.\u201d\n\nThe Doctor made a subdued dash for it,\nAnd propped himself at bay against a pillow.\n\n\u201cNot that way, with your shoes on Kike\u2019s white bed.\nYou can\u2019t rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me, please\u2014I say, don\u2019t touch me, please.\nI\u2019ll not be put to bed by you, my man.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as you say. Have it your own way then.\n\u2018My man\u2019 is it? You talk like a professor.\nSpeaking of who\u2019s afraid of who, however,\nI\u2019m thinking I have more to lose than you\nIf anything should happen to be wrong.\nWho wants to cut your number fourteen throat!\nLet\u2019s have a show down as an evidence\nOf good faith. There is ninety dollars.\nCome, if you\u2019re not afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\nThere\u2019s five: that\u2019s all I carry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can search you?\nWhere are you moving over to? Stay still.\nYou\u2019d better tuck your money under you\nAnd sleep on it the way I always do\nWhen I\u2019m with people I don\u2019t trust at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you believe me if I put it there\nRight on the counterpane\u2014that I do trust you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d say so, Mister Man.\u2014I\u2019m a collector.\nMy ninety isn\u2019t mine\u2014you won\u2019t think that.\nI pick it up a dollar at a time\nAll round the country for the Weekly News,\nPublished in Bow.

There\u2019s nobody about.\nThe chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking.\nAnd I lie back and ride. I take the reins\nOnly when someone\u2019s coming, and the mare\nStops when she likes: I tell her when to go.\nI\u2019ve spoiled Jemima in more ways than one.\nShe\u2019s got so she turns in at every house\nAs if she had some sort of curvature,\nNo matter if I have no errand there.\nShe thinks I\u2019m sociable. I maybe am.\nIt\u2019s seldom I get down except for meals, though.\nFolks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep,\nAll in a family row down to the youngest.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne would suppose they might not be as glad\nTo see you as you are to see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\nBecause I want their dollar. I don\u2019t want\nAnything they\u2019ve not got. I never dun.\nI\u2019m there, and they can pay me if they like.\nI go nowhere on purpose: I happen by.\nSorry there is no cup to give you a drink.\nI drink out of the bottle\u2014not your style.\nMayn\u2019t I offer you\u2014\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as you say. Here\u2019s looking at you then.\u2014\nAnd now I\u2019m leaving you a little while.\nYou\u2019ll rest easier when I\u2019m gone, perhaps\u2014\nLie down\u2014let yourself go and get some sleep.\nBut first\u2014let\u2019s see\u2014what was I going to ask you?\nThose collars\u2014who shall I address them to,\nSuppose you aren\u2019t awake when I come back?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, friend, I can\u2019t let you. You\u2014may need them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot till I shrink, when they\u2019ll be out of style.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut really I\u2014I have so many collars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who I rather would have have them.\nThey\u2019re only turning yellow where they are.\nBut you\u2019re the doctor as the saying is.\nI\u2019ll put the light out. Don\u2019t you wait for me:\nI\u2019ve just begun the night. You get some sleep.\nI\u2019ll knock so-fashion and peep round the door\nWhen I come back so you\u2019ll know who it is.\nThere\u2019s nothing I\u2019m afraid of like scared people.\nI don\u2019t want you should shoot me in the head.\nWhat am I doing carrying off this bottle?\nThere now, you get some sleep.\u201d\n\nHe shut the door.\nThe Doctor slid a little down the pillow.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Chicken-Hearted", "view_node": "/poem/chicken-hearted", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jennifer-givhan\" hreflang=\"en\">Jennifer Givhan</a>", "field_date_published": "2018", "body": " <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time you learn to scrub a chicken.\u201d<br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 Mama rarely cooked after working all day\u2014her heart wasn\u2019t in it.</span><br />But a daughter should know how to sterilize</p><p>that pink, ominous cavern before she flew<br />\u00a0 \u00a0 away to salt her own kitchens: pry its legs apart<br />&amp; reach inside to scoop as if the bird was pregnant.</p><p>When I moved out that winter, pregnant<br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 &amp; fat like nobody\u2019s business but still too chicken to tell</span><br />Mama, I took up with a boy who tore apart</p><p><span class=\"long-line\">our piss cold apartment looking for the piece of his heart he</span><br />\u00a0 \u00a0 swore I\u2019d eaten.

This afternoon the sky is like five portholes between the clouds. The unidentifiable weeds are tall and still unidentifiable and I miss the cows in the field, where have they gone? Sometimes one would wander then stand in the middle of the road and I\u2019d have to stop my car and wait for it to decide to finish crossing. I am drinking seltzer through a straw because of my injury and I have inexplicable bruises on the side of my thigh and I just spent the last five minutes watching a bird through my window sitting in the small crotch where two phone lines x together though it flew off before I could take a picture of it. In the urgent care waiting room this morning there was a magazine with a proven neuroscience article on rituals that will make us happy and the first was practicing gratitude but when I tried to think of something right there next to the guy with the walker and the woman with gauze held to her cheek I came up blank. Because I am a terrible person I will tell you that my neighbor does this thing I hate with her kids called heart-bread, where they\u2019re forced each night before bed to go around one by one and come up with a moment of gratitude and I want to tell her that we can thank anything\u2014the crushed cans in recycling, my wristwatch for keeping time, the rainstorm yesterday that had water pouring from the gutters. I mean, we all overflow; we all feel an abundance of something but sometimes it\u2019s just emptiness: vacant page, busy signal, radio static, implacable repeat rut where the tone arm reaches across a spinning vinyl record to play it again, rest its delicate needle in a groove and caress forever the same sound from the same body. Which is to say that the opposite of ennui is excitement and I\u2019m not feeling it either today even a little. Not in the CVS while browsing the shiny electric rainbow nail-polish display indefinitely while waiting for my prescription. And probably not on my run later no matter how bucolic the mountains seem in the 5pm heat. The second ritual in that article was to touch people, which is easy if you\u2019re with people you can touch but I\u2019m in too loud a solitude and can only touch myself which reminds me of that old Divinyls\u2019 song and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not what the article meant. Buber says you has no borders but he\u2019s talking about god I think since this is not true of us because we all have bodies which make us small countries or maybe islands. If summer means our bodies are more porous perhaps we\u2019re also more open to this inexplicable sadness that hangs here from the cinderblocks, drags itself across the barbed wire fence. What I\u2019m trying to tell you is that I\u2019m not cheered up either. That bird, before it flew off, I like to think of the crossed wires, the impenetrable conversations rushing under its feet. \n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Spirits", "view_node": "/poem/spirits", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-archila\" hreflang=\"en\">William Archila</a>", "field_date_published": "2018", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">At daylight, he surrendered to the gutters\u2019 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">thick cirrhosis, his trajectory </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">half awake, half anvil from the glass to the killing floor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I was raised in, each thin thread tethered </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">from the root of a nicotined tooth </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to the rusted bars of the slammer.\u00a0 I couldn't tell you why </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Felix the Cat came to mind, totally inebriated, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">two Xs, bubbles popping, his gait </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">a saint carried in a procession\u2014Cherry Pink </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">&amp; Apple Blossom White, 1955\u2014</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">except that my grandfather died </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with a bottle in his pocket, his Robert Mitchum</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">chin &amp; pompadour distilled</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from a banana republic in fire, a slow, steady </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">drinker, perfect fulfillment to drown out </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his manhood.
