And once, when I was six,<br />I almost left my mother\u2019s car\u2014outside a bar\u2014<br />because I knew the nearby bottomlands<br />would reach the river, and I could disappear<br />from her and find another family\u2014just<br />show up at some stranger\u2019s door, be taken<br />in, and live a different life. That\u2019s how<br />I thought back then\u2014a determined little cuss,<br />I\u2019m told, who hid my fossils in the snaky<br />roots of trees and sometimes climbed up<br />high inside a thick magnolia, where I<br />refused to answer when my name was<br />called. I think about the times I might have<br />died, my infant brother sliding from the seat<br />to slam against the floorboard, the car<br />stuck sideways down a ditch embankment,<br />the icy nights near swollen creeks and rivers,<br />the woods a child could lose his life in<br />trying to escape. I guess that\u2019s why I<br />listen toward the farthest trees as if a prayer<br />were stirring only I can hear. Perhaps its<br />single word is\u00a0<em>mend</em>, a word that all my<br />other words have felt a kinship with.<br />Evenings when I sit out back, I think my<br />thoughts have always been inclining toward<br />a self whose soul has found a place to be<br />alone, away from others I don\u2019t trust,<br />content to watch the falling leaves. Dull<br />image\u2014perhaps clich\u00e9\u2014but I\u2019ll take it<br />nonetheless. The truth is: here we are<br />inside these lives we sometimes do not<br />recognize, these lives we don\u2019t deserve.<br />So many selves we almost came to be<br />never came to be. So many words too true<br />to whisper to ourselves we go on listening<br />toward. So many bridges never crossed,<br />others stepped back from. So much I\u2019ll<br />never understand about the reasons<br />I survived when others didn\u2019t. Years<br />ago I found a book, like a gift, fallen<br />between two shelves. Inside, someone<br />had penciled,\u00a0<em>Language isn\u2019t sad but</em><br /><em>meaning is</em>. I\u2019ve held those words as<br />close as any I have known, having felt<br />a pull toward nothingness, toward lack<br />of anyone or anything that might repair<br />my ruined thoughts, and just as often<br />I have stood in shallow creeks, waiting<br />on my world to end, assured I have no<br />place, no name, no face, no words to say<br />the source of what I\u2019m always reaching<br />toward. I have followed driftwood,<br />imagined my own dead self assigned<br />to stir above the silt. I\u2019ve watched<br />the motions course along through shadows,<br />soon to reach a bend and carry on unseen.<br />Still, I have a faith that what is next is what<br />the story most requires so that the shape<br />of time allotted, ordained to be, can then<br />reveal itself.\u00a0<em>Bend, mend</em>\u2014the echo isn\u2019t<br />lost on me\u2014and giving in to where I\u2019m<br />being taken has been the way I\u2019ve come<br />to know my life, to speak its mysteries.<br />My guess is such an explanation overlooks<br />as much as it imagines. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve<br />simplified the coarser parts, smoothed<br />them over as a stream refines a stone<br />through centuries. I\u2019ve left out what is<br />obvious to anyone who knows or cares<br />to know the fullness of my life. Even so,<br />once I hid beneath a car, half an hour,<br />refusing to be left somewhere I didn\u2019t<br />want to be\u2014knowing days would pass,<br />my mother drunk. I was caged and fierce<br />despite the gravel shards that scraped<br />my arms and face when finally she caught<br />my leg and jerked my body out. So many<br />times another story line became the thing<br />that almost did me in. My papaw<br />snatched me from a pigpen where I<br />tumbled in one morning while he milked<br />the cows. So many times I\u2019ve wondered<br />what the reasons are for why my life<br />was spared. Curses were all around me\u2014<br />guns, dynamite, darkening fields, coyotes,<br />waterfalls, snake dens, hard-driven men.<br />I stood on snowy hillsides and almost<br />turned to follow logging roads wherever<br />they might lead.
