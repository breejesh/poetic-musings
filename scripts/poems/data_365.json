History<br />here means a history of storms rushing the trees<br />for so long, their bowed shapes seem a kind of star\u2014<br />worth trusting, I mean, as in how the helmsman,<br />steering home, knows what star to lean on. Do<br />people, anymore, even say helmsman? Everything<br />in waves, or at least wave-like, as when another\u2019s<br />suffering, being greater, displaces our own, or<br />I understand it should, which is meant to be<br />different, I\u2019m sure of it, from that pleasure<br />Lucretius speaks of, in witnessing from land<br />a ship foundering at sea, though more and more<br />it all seems related. I love the nights here. I love<br />the jetty\u2019s black ghost-finger, how it calms<br />the harbor, how the fog hanging stranded just<br />above the water is fog, finally, not the left-behind<br />parts of those questions from which I half-wish<br />I could school my mind, desperate cargo,<br />to keep a little distance. An old map from when<br />this place was first settled shows monsters<br />everywhere, once the shore gives out\u2014it can still<br />feel like that: I dive in, and they rise like faithfulness<br />itself, watery pallbearers heading seaward, and<br />I the raft they steady.
