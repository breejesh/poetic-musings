Forgive me as I am<br />destroyed. The submarine of you, mother, has, underwater,<br />shipped me off, has fired on me, is nuclear. Mother,<br />the gold tooth of me is stolen, the frayed cord of me<br />is broken, the scored record of me is frozen, the scratched<br />recording of me is full. Fire on my self pulled from<br />a pile of the wreckage, fire on my plumage-self<br />planned in advance. And decorated for the homecoming<br />and sheltered by the colors and the blending in with ending<br />and the touch of a Cyclops to the backs of wool. Clinging<br />to the belly of the sheep, I come home. Mother, my blood<br />is the blood sum of you and my father. I have no choice. I need<br />your rules. And now the tides come in and, like driftwood, I<br /><span class=\"long-line\">drift, and like summits I rest and like the Eucharist I am blessed,</span><br />and like the lost reflection I am lit from below by what<br /><span class=\"long-line\">appears to be light. I say my name and it ignites. I say my name</span><br />and it tires like a rower on a stolen ship or lags like<br /><span class=\"long-line\">a haggard sail. I lost my veil, I lost my bed, I lost what I thought</span><br />had been said to you to make you understand. You, the shape<br /><span class=\"long-line\">eating waterfowl with bare hands. Mother, your grand chandelier</span><br />of lies has so many eyes it sees like a spider or a fly in every<br />direction; it decides, goes for miles. What opens before you<br /><span class=\"long-line\">is my smile. Empty as a room. Empty as a foot. Empty as a ruse.</span><br />Empty as a lung. Empty as a tongue that has not said. Empty<br />as a vein that has not bled. What am I, mother, but the undead<br />walking the way you want me to walk, the way you want me to<br /><span class=\"long-line\">talk, up from the grave at your command. The zombie I am, covered</span><br />in soot. Soon I swoon and faint and fall. But that is not all. I am<br />the spoon you cook. I am the food you concoct. I am the line<br />you lost with the hook at the end, meant to sink into a mouth.<br /><span class=\"long-line\">My cheek is set, my wretch is good, I am not what wooed you. I am</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">no good. This I know. I had to sew myself shut. For years, I was</span><br />the rut in the good old road. Do not trust the old, do not trust<br />the new, there is nothing to do and nothing can be done.<br />The two were one, now they are two. I was born, I was new,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">then I spoke, I was no good, I was me, I had flaws countless and</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">contagious as disease, not the least of which grew. I was me, I was</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">mine, I was not yours. I could not be you. Mother, you took from me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the drought and gave it meaning, you smacked the pout right off</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">my feeling, you kept stars lit on the ceiling so you could navigate</span><br />out from my room. It was noon when the sun set in you. I felt<br />the earth cool. I felt the fires lit so those of us who survived<br /><span class=\"long-line\">could go on living. I felt the beasts arrive when night was confirmed.</span><br />You killed us off. You felt you\u2019d earned it, the right to make us<br /><span class=\"long-line\">into what fears and what crouches and what grows cold. I could not</span><br />grow older. I could not mature. I was sure there was nothing<br />left. What I felt in the end was the blow of yours<br />sent across the miles to find me where I lay spent<br />and desert-like in the heat. Keep me here. I serve<br />your needs. The edges of me, mother. I cannot be<br />until you let me recover. I cannot run to the subset<br /><span class=\"long-line\">of another. You are too wise, you know what the constant light</span><br />means, you know what grows where and how to twist it<br />when the darkness meets it so that it can moss over and meld<br />into a growth that will melt it down. You fungi plus silk,<br />the lurch of me is trying to unlearn all the confusions of you.<br />Mother, mother, quite contrary, how does your deadliness<br />grow? With a tooth and a rack and a craw and a sack<br />and all the daughters caught in their rows.</p> "}, {"title": "Dark and Lovely After Take-Off (A Future)", "view_node": "/poem/dark-and-lovely-after-take-future", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/yona-harvey\" hreflang=\"en\">Yona Harvey</a>", "field_date_published": "2018", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Nobody straightens their hair anymore.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Space trips &amp; limited air supplies will get you conscious quick.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">My shea-buttered braids glow planetary</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as I turn unconcerned, unburned by the pre-take-off bother.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cLeave it all behind,\u201d my mother\u2019d told me,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sweeping the last specs of copper thread from her front porch steps &amp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">just as quick, she turned her back to me.
