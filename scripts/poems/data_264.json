I fantasised a miracle<br />in that moment, but I blame the sun for that.<br /><span class=\"long-line\">And then the boy take his stance. Classic poise, bat tapping,</span></p><p>looking like a test class stroke-player, toes shuffling,<br /><span class=\"long-line\">waiting for the pace bowler sprinting stallion along the worn</span><br />dry grass. Up to the wicket, he bowls, good length ball,</p><p>dead on mid and off.
