Weightless in the palm,<br />the shoulder is sharp to mark the exact<br />depth of engagement. A jagged range<br />of peaks garnish the shaft, align<br />with wards in the pin tumbler keyway<br />and unlock the door, swung open to reveal</p><p>the kingdom. Of rain, of infancy, kingdom<br />of clapboard, concealed carry, of the night shift<br />at Frito-Lay, nuclear gerontology at Los Alamos,<br />L-shaped couches, tributaries of heroin up<br />the Mississippi basin, of prison writing workshops,<br />kingdom of arugula, of a slaughtered pee wee team<br />invoking the mercy rule, peaches and asters, of<br />helicopter cinematography, a girl blowing bubbles<br />over the river, of a poet unable to sustain<br />the Blakean conviction that all subjectivities,<br />predator and prey, are holy, that police are,<br />a coyote stalking the pinnacles, bald eagle at the zoo.</p><p>In that kingdom there is a state, \u201cthe state<br />with the prettiest name,\u201d land of flowers<br />on the conquistador\u2019s tongue, the state of\u00a0<br />brackish water, coastline and glade, made\u00a0<br />habitable by sugar and central air, porn mecca<br />with oranges, flakka zombie flail, grandchildren<br />lollygagging in manatee exhibits, space exploration<br />over a red tide choking the cape east of the <em>polis\u00a0</em>\u00a0<br />where a dance club pulses until a man<br />enucleates its love. If blinded by hatred<br />of those unlike himself, or by hatred of himself,<br />the stem that anchors the thorn is the same.\u00a0<br /><br />In that state there is a city, initiating its morning<br />thaw, flag over the courthouse at half mast,<br />a hollow sidewalk yawning to accept boxes of granola,<br />olives, wheels of manchego slid down into the deli\u2019s<br />larder, newspapers slung at stoops from the window<br />of a crawling minivan, women in yoga pants<br />clutching Lululemon mats like scrolls, diesel exhaust,<br />certified nurses in scrubs streaming into the hospital<br />where a man bleeds from a hole in his still<br />uncertain future and a woman veers into labor,<br />the ovaries in the fetus in her womb already freighted<br />with all the egg cells her child will possess.</p><p>Over that city there is a forecast, severe weather,<br />a storm that hangs like a decaying gourd from twine<br />in the kingdom\u2019s portico, gourd of a variety present<br />in the New World before Columbus, the exact moment<br />of its breaking impossible to predict but certain<br />to arrive when its curved neck can no longer<br />sustain the weight of its own rot and snaps, drops,<br />blows open nutty white flesh on steps below,<br />gale force and hail wrung out of the jet stream\u2019s<br />trough and bulge contact zones, over grasslands then<br />south to the city where white men confuse any threat<br />to their absolute power as a form of persecution.</p><p>In that storm there is a house, its roofline lashed<br />by rain that courses down asphalt shingles<br />to decorative gables, slides over dormers,<br />pools in gutters then runs down downspouts<br />onto the saturated lawn, water wrapping the house<br />like a body in muslin. A house in old Colonial style<br />but thrown off by additions in the back, interior walls<br />subtracted for flow, a decade-by-decade replacement<br />of hardwood floors, fixtures, the chimney sealed up,<br />molting over generations each original element<br />like the ship of Theseus, this poem of slow violence<br />with bodies that change in a form that remains.</p><p>And now that she is at rest, poor woman,<br />now that the sky\u2019s ritual errancies have tried<br />to sack her house and failed, and fled,<br />Justine is alone again. A black kerchief\u00a0<br />tied across her eyes, she measures in darkness<br />ground coffee beans strong as rocket fuel<br />on a digital scale, pours steaming water in circles<br />to bloom the beans. When the brew is rich<br />and viscous, she glides to her typewriter and writes<br />\u201cIn that house there is only this room.\u201d<br />She removes her sword from the wall<br />and cuts the blindfold from her eyes.</p><p>In that room there is a bed, Justine\u2019s bed,<br />tucked with hospital corners, quilt spread<br />tight as a drum skin and depicting a black cross<br />side to side, toe to head, marking the kingdom\u2019s<br />epicenter in crosshairs beneath which she nightly\u00a0<br />slept. The bed is empty. Justine is gone. She drags<br />her sword through thick woods, alive with new\u00a0<br />perceptual acuity, hacking at brambles, hoverflies<br />mobbing her head as she reaches the brook, blade<br />glinting with orange flecks of sunset as she writes<br />the word \u201cretribution\u201d in the sky, leaving tracers<br />in her vision like a sparkler on the Fourth of July.</p><p>On the bed Justine left behind, there is a book<br />bound in leather, the one that wrote her into allegory<br />long before statues in her honor were erected<br />in civil squares, dog eared at the passage in which<br />she is still an ideal, standing blind in train tracks<br />with a falcon on her shoulder. Before she sees<br />the locomotive, she hears the bell, bell, bell,\u00a0<br />feels the ties tremble, and then the engine\u2019s<br />pistons announcing the arrival of freight: an eight<br />ton Bearcat armored personnel vehicle, assault rifles,<br />Kevlar helmets, pilotless surveillance drone, hounds of hell,<br />bomb-disarming robots and 400 sworn officers of the law.</p><p>In the final pages of that book there is a flowering plant,<br />blue false indigo, native to America, growing wild\u00a0<br />at the border of the forest where Justine now stands,<br />its roots described as woody, black, unkillable, branching<br />underground in a rhizomatic hydra of power belonging<br />to no one, to all, its genus derived from the Greek,<br /><em>bapto</em>, as in dip, immerse, baptize, and make new<br />from criminal soil. In writing, the plant is motionless,<br />an image that flickers in the mind and recedes again<br />into the grammar of its making, but in the wind<br />that wraps Justine just now, the plant is stereoscopic,<br />grey-green leaves waving, violet flowers in riot.\u00a0</p><p>In that plant there is a sap that goes blue<br />on contact with oxygen. It contains a toxin.\u00a0<br />Toxic blue dye comes alive as Justine slices<br />into the hairless stem. Silken weapon, it beads<br />then streams toward her heels, a blue<br />the Greeks could not see, blue of the ribbon<br />holding back Washington\u2019s hair, blue robin egg<br />hidden in the nest, blue of the officer\u2019s uniform<br />the moment before he raises his firearm, Neptune\u2019s<br />blue glow, blue of her birth certificate and a darker<br />blue passport embossed with the kingdom\u2019s gold eagle,<br />one talon for the olive branch, one for the arrows.</p><p>In that blue there is a belief<br />that the kingdom\u2019s dome has been sealed<br />from within, that the exceptions have devoured<br />the rule, that the watchers need watched<br />and the charges dismissed, that the presumption<br />of safety has been put on permanent layaway<br />for those not born into it, a presumption replaced<br />with this color that cuts, as it has, as it must,<br />both ways. Justine\u2019s eyes ache. The sky<br />is bright with exhortation. She fills each vial<br />like an inkwell, clambers over monster ferns,<br />and heads to the city to face the king.</p><p>Belief in the blue, in its cruel illusion<br />of <em>habeas corpus</em>, of \u201cYou may have a body.\u201d<br />Blue in the sap, in its toxin of last resort.<br />Sap in the plant, blue false indigo,<br />its deep and communal roots. Plant<br />in the book where Justine\u2019s an ideal.</p><p>Book on the bed in the room she fled<br />for the city, where if you stand, if you run,<br />if you resist or comply, where if your pants<br />are low or high, where to be visible is to hang<br />in the balance. Bed in the room, room in the house<br />where she cut the kerchief from her eyes.</p><p>House in a storm mistaking its temporary<br />strength as permanent weather, storm in the city<br />where Justine follows a river of others<br />into the tear gas plume. City in the state<br />with the prettiest name, state in the kingdom<br />that forgot its key and kicked in the door.</p> "}, {"title": "Little George", "view_node": "/poem/little-george", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/mark-doty\" hreflang=\"und\">Mark Doty</a>", "field_date_published": "2016", "body": " <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 barks at whatever\u2019s<br />not the world as he prefers to know it:<br />trash sacks, hand trucks, black hats, canes<br />and hoods, shovels, someone smoking a joint<br />beneath the Haitian Evangelicals\u2019 overhang,<br />anyone\u2014how dare they\u2014walking a dog.<br />George barks, the tense white comma<br />of himself arced in alarm.<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At home he floats<br />in the creaturely domestic: curled in the warm<br />triangle behind a sleeper\u2019s knees,<br />wiggling on his back on the sofa, all jelly<br />and sighs, requesting/receiving a belly rub.<br />No worries.
