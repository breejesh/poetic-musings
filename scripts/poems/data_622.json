One more could finally break it\nirretrievably, and I don't want that kind of metaphorical blood\non my hands. So this time around, let the heart be the heart\nthe surgeon discovers when he lays open the chest so gently\nit's easy to miss the self-effacing beauty of precision,\nthe way he comes at it directly, the only way he knows.\nAnd the heart, exposed exactly for what it is: homelier\nthan we'd like to imagine. And alive beyond compare.\nHere, the heart is the heart, and isn't\na fist or a flower or a smooth-running engine\nand especially not one of those ragged valentines\nsomeone's cut out, initialed, shot full of cartoon arrows:\nthe adolescent voodoo of desire. Here nothing's colored\nthat impossibly red.\n\nThere's nothing cute about it. The heart\nis the heart, chamber after chamber. Ventricular. Uncooked.\nIn all its sanguine glory. I couldn't make up a thing\nlike that. The heart's perfected its daily making do, the sucking\nand pumping, its mindless work: sustaining a blood supply\nthat's got to go around a lifetime.\nSure, there's a brain somewhere, another planet\njust seconds or light-years away, and maybe some far-flung\nintelligence madly signalling for all it's worth--\nbut the heart wouldn't know about that. It has its own\nevidence to go on. What's convincing to the heart\nis only the heart. It doesn't have the luxury of stopping\nto weigh, to reconsider, to fold and unfold the raw data of the world\nuntil it's creased beyond recognition. Some days it can't distinguish \na single sad note from a chorus of exhilaration, but still\nthe heart has its one answer down to a science: <i>yes</i>. Over\nand over, that iambic <i>uh-huh</i>. Whatever it takes, some kind of nerve\nor unlikely grace: the heart never knows what to think.\n\n* * *\n\nIf this poem has had its moments already\nwhen I haven't been quite as good as my word--\nwhen the heart's been anything less than the heart\nor even the tiniest bit more--believe me, I've tried\nhard to keep the heart in its proper place for once.

And it's yours.\nWe fit together so well sometimes it's not easy\ntelling whose lips, whose arms, whose heat in the groin,\nwhose very good idea. I'm not taking any chances\nbigger than the one you've given me--your insistent heart\nmixed up with mine: <i>uh-huh, uh-huh, huh-huh</i>,\nand my heart has never been the heart it is right now.\nIt's what we've both been waiting for: I'm asking you\nto make of it what you surely will, to take it from here,\nin your love beyond these imperfect words, please\ntake it wherever you're going tonight from here.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Mambo", "view_node": "/poem/mambo", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jaime-manrique\" hreflang=\"und\">Jaime Manrique</a>", "field_date_published": "1996", "body": " <p>(Skip to the <a href=\"#spanish\">original poem in Spanish</a>)</p><p><em>translated by Edith Grossman</em></p>\n<pre>Against a topaz sky\nand huge windows starry \nwith delirious heartsease\nand sensual red cayenne;\nthe sweet twilight breeze\nfragrant with almond and Indian orange;\non the Moorish tiles,\nwearing their spike-heeled shoes,\nlowcut dresses and wide swirling skirts;\ntheir long obsidian hairdos\nin the style of the time;\nperfumed, olive-skinned, smiling,\nmy aunts danced the mambo\nand sang: \"Doctor, tomorrow, \nyou can't pull my tooth\neven if I die of the pain.\"\n\nthose evenings of my childhood\nwhen my aunts were young and belonged to me,\nand I danced hiding in their skirts,\nour lives were a happy mambo\u2014\nI remember.</pre>\n<hr /><p><a name=\"spanish\" id=\"spanish\"></a></p>\n<pre>Contra un cielo topacio\ny ventanales estrellados\ncon delirantes trinitarias\ny rojas, sensuales cayenas;\nel fragante c\u00e9firo verpertino\noloroso de almendros y azahar de la India;\nsobre las baldozsas de dise\u00f1os moriscos,\ncon zapatillas de tac\u00f3n aguja,\nvestidos descotados y amplias polleras;\nsus largas, obsidianas cabelleras\na la usanza de la \u00e9poca;\nperfumadas, trigue\u00f1as, risue\u00f1as,\nmis t\u00edas bailaban el mambo\ncanturreando, \"Doctor, ma\u00f1ana\nno me saca ud. la muela,\naunque me muera del dolor.\"\n\nAquellas tardes en mi infancia\ncuando mis t\u00edas eran muchanchas y me pertenec\u00edan,\ny yo bailaba cobijado entre sus polleras,\nnuestras vidas eran un mambo feliz\nque no se olvida.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Love Opened a Mortal Wound", "view_node": "/poem/love-opened-mortal-wound", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/sor-juana-ines-de-la-cruz\" hreflang=\"und\">Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz</a>", "field_date_published": "1997", "body": "<blockquote><sup><em>translated by <a href=\"https://poets.org/poet/joan-larkin\">Joan Larkin</a> and <a href=\"https://poets.org/poet/jaime-manrique\">Jaime Manrique</a></em></sup></blockquote>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Love opened a mortal wound. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In agony, I worked the blade </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to make it deeper.
