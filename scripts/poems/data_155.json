class=\"long-line\">Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospital,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid down,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a lily,)</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it all,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, some of them dead,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, odor of blood,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill'd,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death-spasm sweating,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Then hear outside the orders given, <em>Fall in, my men, fall in;</em></span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">The unknown road still marching.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "By the Bivouac&#039;s Fitful Flame", "view_node": "/poem/bivouacs-fitful-flame", "field_author": "<a
