a monster whale came to Dundee,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Resolved for a few days to sport and play,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And devour the small fishes in the silvery Tay.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">So the monster whale did sport and play</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Among the innocent little fishes in the beautiful Tay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Until he was seen by some men one day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And they resolved to catch him without delay.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">When it came to be known a whale was seen in the Tay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some men began to talk and to say,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We must try and catch this monster of a whale,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So come on, brave boys, and never say fail.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Then the people together in crowds did run,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Resolved to capture the whale and to have some fun!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So small boats were launched on the silvery Tay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While the monster of the deep did sport and play.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Oh! it was a most fearful and beautiful sight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To see it lashing the water with its tail all its might,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And making the water ascend like a shower of hail,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With one lash of its ugly and mighty tail.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Then the water did descend on the men in the boats,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which wet their trousers and also their coats;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But it only made them the more determined to catch the whale,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the whale shook at them his tail.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Then the whale began to puff and to blow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While the men and the boats after him did go,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Armed well with harpoons for the fray,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which they fired at him without dismay.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">And they laughed and grinned just like wild baboons,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While they fired at him their sharp harpoons:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when struck with the harpoons he dived below,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which filled his pursuers\u2019 hearts with woe:</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Because they guessed they had lost a prize,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which caused the tears to well up in their eyes;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in that their anticipations were only right,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Because he sped on to Stonehaven with all his might:</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">And was first seen by the crew of a Gourdon fishing boat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which they thought was a big coble upturned afloat;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when they drew near they saw it was a whale,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So they resolved to tow it ashore without fail.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">So they got a rope from each boat tied round his tail,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And landed their burden at Stonehaven without fail;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And when the people saw it their voices they did raise,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Declaring that the brave fishermen deserved great praise.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">And my opinion is that God sent the whale in time of need,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No matter what other people may think or what is their creed;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I know fishermen in general are often very poor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And God in His goodness sent it to drive poverty from their door.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">So Mr John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty-six pound,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And has brought it to Dundee all safe and all sound;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which measures 40 feet in length from the snout to the tail,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"\u201clong-line\u201d\">Then hurrah! for the mighty monster whale,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which has got 17 feet 4 inches from tip to tip of a tail!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which can be seen for a sixpence or a shilling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That is to say, if the people all are willing.</span></p>\n"},

there! my fathe\u2019s dinner horn. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The sun blazed after dinner so </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We sat a while by the maple trees, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thinking of mother\u2019s pickles and pies </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And smoking a friendly pipe at ease. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I broached a point of piety, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For pious men are quick to tease: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was it really true John dipped his crowd </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down in the muddy Jordan\u2019s lees ? </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And couldn\u2019t the Baptists backslide too </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If only they went on Methodist sprees? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And finally back to the field we went, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The corn was well above my knees, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The weeds were more than ankle high, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And dangerous customers were these. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We went to work in the heat again, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I hoped we d get a bit of breeze </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And thought the hired man was used </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To God\u2019s most blazing cruelties. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Sundays, the hired man would pray </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To live in the sunshine of his face; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now here was answer come complete, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rather an overdose of grace! </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He fell in the furrow, an honest place </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And an easy place for a man to fall. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His horse went marching blindly on </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In a beautiful dream of a great fat stall. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And God shone on in merry mood, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For it was a foolish kind of sprawl, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I found a hulk of heaving meat </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That wouldn\u2019t answer me at all, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And a fresh breeze made the young corn dance </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To a bright green, glorious carnival. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And really, is it not a gift </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To smile and be divinely gay, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To rise above a circumstance </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And smile distressing scenes away? </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But this was a thing that I had said, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I was so froward and untamed: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cI will not worship wickedness </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though it be God s I am ashamed! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For all his mercies God be thanked </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But for his tyrannies be blamed! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He shall not have my love alone, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With loathing to his name is named.\" </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I caught him up with all my strength </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with a silly stumbling tread </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I dragged him over the soft brown dirt </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And dumped him down beside the shed. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I thought of the prayers the fool had prayed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To his God, and I was seeing red, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When all of a sudden he gave a heave </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And then with shuddering vomited! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And God, who had just received full thanks </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For all his kindly daily bread, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now called it back again perhaps </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To see that his birds of the air were fed. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not mother\u2019s dainty dinner now, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A rather horrible mess instead, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet all of it God required of him </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Before the fool was duly dead. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Even of deaths there is a choice, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019ve seen you give a good one, God, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But he in his vomit laid him down, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Denied the decency of blood. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">If silence from the dead, I swore, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There shall be cursing from the quick! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I began to vomit too, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cursing and vomit ever so thick; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The dead lay down, and I did too, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Two ashy idiots: take your pick ! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A little lower than angels he made us, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Hear his excellent rhetoric), </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A credit we were to him, half of us dead, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The other half of us lying sick. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The little clouds came Sunday-dressed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To do a holy reverence, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The young corn smelled its sweetest too, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And made him goodly frankincense, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The thrushes offered music up, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Choired in the wood beyond the fence. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And while his praises rilled the earth </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A solitary crow sailed by, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And while the whole creation sang </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He cawed not knowing how to sigh.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "The Tay Bridge Disaster", "view_node": "/poem/tay-bridge-disaster", "field_author": "<a

walls</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">anytime I stand before the mirror</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the image of an upside-down tortoise</span><br /><span

out</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the ruins of Bam scribbled out</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the shelters we built</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">collapsing on our heads</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I am terrified by the next images in this poem</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the image of God lifting all the doors onto his shoulders</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">getting away</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">retreating far and then farther</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I write: one day</span><br
