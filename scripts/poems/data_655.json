Wherever we go, we're not alone \nfor an hour, devoted hobblers on the block, the odd couple-- \nlong-legged bony man jogging along, obeying the leash law, \n\nthe black, retractable nylon sagging back to Oscar, who never balks \nor sasses when I give the dangling leash a shake, but trots to me \ndesperate for affection, panting like a dog off to see Santa, \nwilling to jog any block for a voice, a scratch on the back. \n\nI've seen that hunger in other dogs.  I watched my wife \nfor forty years brush dogs that didn't need the love he does. \nWhen my children visit, my oldest grandsons trot with him \nto the park, that glossy, auburn sausage tugging and barking, \n\nshowing off.  The toddlers squat and pat him on his back. \nThey touch his nose and laugh, and make him lick them on the lips. \nGood Oscar never growls, not even if they fall atop him. \nHe was a gift from them, last Christmas, a dog their pop \n\ncould take for walks and talk to.  Oscar would have loved my wife, \nwho spoiled and petted our old dogs for decades, coaxing them up \nfor tidbits on the couch beside her, offering all the bliss \na dog could wish for, a hand to lick, a lap to lay their heads. \n\nOh, he's already spoiled, barks at bluejays on his bowl, \nfat and lonely unless I'm home.  But how groomed and frisky \nhe could be if she were here, how calm to see us both \nby the fire, rocking, talking, turning out the lights. </pre>\n<pre>\n</pre>\n<p class=\"XSMALL\"><i>For
