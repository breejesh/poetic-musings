thirteen.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Her stepmother,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a beauty in her own right,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">though eaten, of course, by age,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">would hear of no beauty surpassing her own.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beauty is a simple passion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but, oh my friends, in the end</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">you will dance the fire dance in iron shoes.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The stepmother had a mirror to which she<span class=\"long-line\">referred--</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">something like the weather forecast--</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a mirror that proclaimed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the one beauty of the land.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She would ask,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Looking glass upon the wall,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">who is fairest of us all?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the mirror would reply,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You are the fairest of us all.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pride pumped in her like poison.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly one day the mirror replied,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Queen, you are full fair, 'tis true,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but Snow White is fairer than you.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Until that moment Snow White</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">had been no more important</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">than a dust mouse under the bed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But now the queen saw brown spots on her hand</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and four whiskers over her lip</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so she condemned Snow White</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to be hacked to death.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bring me her heart, she said to the hunter,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and I will salt it and eat it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The hunter, however, let his prisoner go</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and brought a boar's heart back to the castle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The queen chewed it up like a cube steak.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now I am fairest, she said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">lapping her slim white fingers.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Snow White walked in the wildwood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for weeks and weeks.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At each turn there were twenty doorways</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and at each stood a hungry wolf,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his tongue lolling out like a worm.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The birds called out lewdly,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">talking like pink parrots,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and the snakes hung down in loops,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">each a noose for her sweet white neck.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the seventh week</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">she came to the seventh mountain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and there she found the dwarf house.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It was as droll as a honeymoon cottage</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and completely equipped with</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">seven beds, seven chairs, seven forks</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and seven chamber pots.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Snow White ate seven chicken livers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and lay down, at last, to sleep.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The dwarfs, those little hot dogs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">walked three times around Snow

class=\"long-line\">Yes.\u00a0 It's a<span class=\"long-line\">good omen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they said, and will bring us luck.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They stood on tiptoes to watch</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Snow White wake up.\u00a0 She told them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">about the mirror and the killer-queen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and they asked her to stay and keep house.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beware of your stepmother,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they said.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon she will know you are here.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While we are away in the mines</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">during the day, you must not</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">open the door.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Looking glass upon the wall . . .</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The mirror told</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and so the queen dressed herself in rags</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and went out like a peddler to trap Snow White.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She went across seven mountains.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She came to the dwarf house</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and Snow White opened the door</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and bought a bit of lacing.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The queen fastened it tightly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">around her bodice,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as tight as an Ace bandage,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so tight that Snow White swooned.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She lay on the floor, a plucked daisy.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the dwarfs came home they undid the lace</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and she revived miraculously.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She was as full of life as soda pop.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beware of your stepmother,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they said.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She will try once more.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Looking glass upon the wall. . .</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Once more the mirror told</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and once more the queen dressed in rags</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and once more Snow White opened the door.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This time she bought a poison comb, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a curved eight-inch scorpion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and put it in her hair and swooned again.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The dwarfs returned and took out the comb</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and she revived miraculously.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She opened her eyes as wide as Orphan Annie.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beware, beware, they said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but the mirror told,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the queen came,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Snow White, the dumb bunny,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">opened the door</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and she bit into a poison apple</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and fell down for the final time.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the dwarfs returned</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they undid her bodice,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they looked for a comb,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but it did no good.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though they washed her with wine</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and rubbed her with butter</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">it was to no avail.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She lay as still as a gold piece.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The seven dwarfs could not bring themselves</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to bury her in the black ground</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so they made a glass coffin</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and set it upon the seventh mountain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so that all who passed by</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">could peek in upon her beauty.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A prince came one June day</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and would not budge.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He stayed so long his hair turned green</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and still he would not leave.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The dwarfs took pity upon him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and gave him the glass Snow White--</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">its doll's eyes shut forever--</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to keep in his far-off castle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As the prince's men carried the coffin</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they stumbled and dropped it</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and the chunk of apple flew out</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of her throat and she woke up miraculously.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And thus Snow White became the prince's bride.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The wicked queen was invited to the wedding feast</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and when she arrived there were</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">red-hot iron shoes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the manner of red-hot roller skates,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">clamped upon her feet.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">First your toes will smoke</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and then your heels will turn black</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and you will fry upward like a frog,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">she was told.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And so she danced until she was dead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a subterranean figure,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">her tongue flicking in and out</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like a gas jet.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile Snow White held court,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">rolling her china-blue doll eyes open and shut</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and sometimes referring to her mirror</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as women do.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Central Park, Carousel", "view_node":
