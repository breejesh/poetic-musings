My hands are the wrong</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">shape to hide behind. I see the murderers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and stand in front of them, refusing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">everything they are. I am weaponless.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I know guns from my childhood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and know their sick laugh, their</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">self-certainty, their imitations of \u2018sound\u2019\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">their chatter. Yes, of course it\u2019s death</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">they make, even when the target</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is a symbol or a bull\u2019s eye\u2014names</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">say it all, underneath\u2014target shooting,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but it\u2019s not selective at the end of the breathing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the last bottle of O negative blood, it takes all</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in its recoil as much as its impact, it kills</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">life and it kills death and it is given</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">an \u2018out\u2019 through Keats\u2019s white as death</span><br />\n\u2018<span class=\"long-line\">half in love with easeful death\u2019\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a poem I have recited since I was</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sixteen, have recited on the verge of death,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as if it was a way through when it wasn\u2019t.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The poem separated from the hand</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that wrote it makes a travesty</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of reality\u2014the corpses piling</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">up in the\u00a0<em>feint</em> light of whiteness.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The poem was part of the problem</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">born in the eye of empire, the smell</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of hospitals and anatomies, and yet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I lament his terrible tragic passing.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I have stood in his deathroom</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and only thought of a young person</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and their overwhelming death,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the steps flowing with people</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as now they are empty of both</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rome and world. I think the same</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the acts of medicine the acts</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of insurance and discrimination,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and those who take the brunt of economies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">especially in Western economies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that live off the labour of re-arranged</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and redecorated class alienation.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What you say is true and needs</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to be said in such a way, Kwame.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am saying as an aside to all tyranny,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that using the methods of the tyrannical</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">will lead to ongoing tyranny. Refusal</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to do anything for them, to stop using their goods,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to stop giving them anything at all, will soon \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 bring their collapse.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Total and utter refusal.\u00a0<em>But then</em>, they are</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">even prepared for that\u2014bringing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">it all down makes the suffering</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">suffer more via the pain \u2018brought</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on themselves.\u2019 That\u2019s tyranny\u2019s propaganda.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0White bigots and the bigotry</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">implicit in any notion of \u2018whiteness\u2019<br /><span class=\"long-line\">search for validation even where</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">it is bluntly refused\u2014they enforce</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">their validation, legitimise themselves</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in every conversation. I guess</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that might be what Spike Lee</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and Chuck D. have been saying</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">forever\u2014the very notion\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2018white folk\u2019 have any rights</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of control or even say in other</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">people\u2019s (and peoples\u2019) lives needs</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">undoing. Your poem helps protect</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the vulnerable and thwart the murderous\u2014confront</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">them with its declarations of blackness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and that\u2019s as it must be, and you must say,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">given the traumatic reality, Kwame.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I listen to Sly Dunbar</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">not to absorb into what I have</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">been made from, but to reflect</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">against and learn from\u2014to learn</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is to respect and not just</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">be awed and\u00a0<em>entertained</em>, those</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">shrouds across creativity,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">those thefts as deadly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as going armed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with intent.
