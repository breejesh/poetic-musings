labor of creation, or love\u2014<br />Maybe not the gold doubloon, but a shell<br />With the ocean where a creature should be.<br />For the first time, you hear your lover\u2019s voice<br />Singing a language you don\u2019t understand,<br />And the words you once knew lose their meanings.<br />I am so confused by this new feeling.<br />My greatest fear is I will outlive it.</p><p>Everything seems to be going well, but<br />Who knows well when less is nowhere near?<br />There is such a thing as a perfect storm,<br />When all the elements of misfortune<br />Converge to produce a great disaster<br />(One of the elements must be belief,<br />The others should be time and sacrifice),<br />Which descends upon a decent person<br />Who stands beside some mean, magnetic soul<br />To hide their darkness in another\u2019s light.</p><p>I am anxious because my life is good<br />And I love a world I will have destroyed<br />Just as the rotten persona I\u2019ve made<br />Transubstantiates in the tendency<br />Of burning to offer upward its ash.<br />While my sweetheart works overtime this week<br />I have spent my hours alone dismantling<br />The appalling device in my basement,<br />But as I pull it apart it mocks me,<br />Knowing as I do it has done its work.</p><p>Millions of miles away, death from above<br />Speeds through the solar system, approaching<br />The planet where Mahler wrote his music.<br />It will be a defunct truth that kills me<br />And the sight of a serpent in the sky<br />Will be the final sign the condemned see.<br />If only I had despised the winter<br />Instead of the cold itself, I could have<br />Found some relief in fashion and designed<br />Warm shadows instead of a burning crown.</p><p>One must be well acquainted with the charms<br />Of decorative dishes and warm pies<br />To know the power that a caterwaul<br />At midnight may have over someone lost<br />In chapter nine of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>,<br />In which Darcy and Elizabeth speak<br />Of poetry\u2019s relationship to sex.<br />Everyone knows what happens in the end,<br />But the end is just a catastrophe,<br />The good bits are in the complication.</p><p>Aristotle can be hard to follow<br />But tragedy is simplified in love.<br />At first, one seems to look at a stranger<br />In the mirror, and life is love reversed,<br />Then their reflection proves insubstantial<br />For conversations and convergences.<br />I am at this moment in my story<br />And have no idea how it will feel<br />To arrive with another at a shrine<br />With meanings both joyous and saturnine.</p><p>The other day I went out for pizza<br />With the woman who holds my hand in hers,<br />And the roads of our hunger there diverged.<br />We ordered a large half-mushroom, half-cheese<br />So we could our own ways together go,<br />But by the time the waiter brought our food<br />We had forgotten who had chosen what<br />And feasted without discrimination.<br />The desire to know each other\u2019s desire<br />Had overwhelmed the knowledge of our own.</p><p>Transcendent moments become memories<br />Like everything else, and maybe that is<br />An error in the making of the world.<br />What if evolution\u2019s fundamental<br />Force were not endurance, but amazement?<br />Or what if everything already runs<br />Zigzag toward heaven and I am wrong?<br />What if a giraffe stretches out its neck<br />Seeking not fulfillment but pleasing form,<br />And nature is guided by beauty\u2019s voice?<br />\u00a0</p> "}, {"title": "The End
