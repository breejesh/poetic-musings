In the mind of Endtime it looks like this: shell, volute, Tabriz, eddies, and tides. Flowers wilt. When you wake, observe the unmitigated trials and tribulations of these tossed things, random it seems. But in the endtime, less personhood more ransom. Radical sleep in the Endtime, there is no end of sleep. Multiplying the stars was never easy in Endtime, doing it by themselves, obstinate stars. Self-repairing and learning on the job. Write reports, sniff out plagiarism, fly your planes with a computer. Drones inhabit the Endtime lore, how many kills. In Endtime things go static. Then still. Switch off \u201csolace.\u201d Would you kill another literary form? a ransom note perhaps, saying again:\u00a0<em>The dead always will be saying too many of us</em><em>!</em> Then carry the corpses around.

A mole might do for you, a burrowing animal \u201cthing\u201d might do, biding time might do for a time, a night perhaps you have for rhetoric, before you are released at dawn.

You keep churning and there\u2019s an echo in the world. In the Endtime no need of explanation. Need stronger better experienced cop? He\u2019s a baby. In the Endtime there are theories of dysfunction, delicate wheelworks that need retread. In the mind of the Endtime scot-free isn\u2019t possible. No interpretation necessary for your cargo. But tax and a search and a fee and a calibration what it all adds up to. Then drop it.
