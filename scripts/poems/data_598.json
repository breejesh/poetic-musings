Then comes \nMy first breakfast. I can't cook \nSo it's only tea, puffed wheat and \nPepperidge Farm biscuits. \nThen a cigar.

class=\"long-line\">and efficient!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Early in the morning</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">it wakes up the sirens</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and dispatches ambulances</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to various places</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">swings corpses through the air</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">rolls stretchers to the wounded</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">summons rain</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from the eyes of mothers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">digs into the earth</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">dislodging many things</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from under the ruins...</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some are lifeless and glistening</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">others are pale and still throbbing...</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It produces the most questions</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the minds of children</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">entertains the gods</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">by shooting fireworks and missiles</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into the sky</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sows mines in the fields</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and reaps punctures and blisters</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">urges families to emigrate</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">stands beside the clergymen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as they curse the devil</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(poor devil, he remains</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with one hand in the searing fire)...</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The war continues working, day and night.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It inspires tyrants</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to deliver long speeches</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">awards medals to generals</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and themes to poets</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">it contributes to the industry</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of artificial limbs</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">provides food for flies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">adds pages to the history books</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">achieves equality</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">between killer and killed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">teaches lovers to write letters</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">accustoms young women to waiting</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">fills the newspapers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with articles and pictures</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">builds new houses</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for the orphans</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">invigorates the coffin makers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">gives grave diggers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a pat on the back</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and paints a smile on the leader's face.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It works with unparalleled diligence!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet no one gives it</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a word of praise.</span></p>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 598, "total_items": "13248",
