There is no fence, though here and there a weathered post asserts a former claim, strands of fallen wire taken by the dust. To the left a cornfield carries into the distance, dips and rises to the blue sky, a rolling plain of green and healthy plants aligned in close order, row upon row upon row. To the right, a field of wheat, a field of hay, young grasses breaking the soil, filling their allotted land with the rich, slow-waving spectacle of their grain. As for the farmers, they are, for the most part, indistinguishable: here the tractor is red, there yellow; here a pair of dirty hands, there a pair of dirty hands. They are cultivators of the soil. They grow crops by pattern, by acre, by foresight, by habit. What corn is to one, wheat is to the other, and though to some eyes the similarities outweigh the differences it would be as unthinkable for the second to commence planting corn as for the first to switch over to wheat. What happens in the gully between them is no concern of theirs, they say, so long as the plough stays out, the weeds stay in the ditch where they belong, though anyone would notice the wind-sewn cornstalks poking up their shaggy ears like young lovers run off into the bushes, and the kinship of these wild grasses with those the farmer cultivates is too obvious to mention, sage and dun-colored stalks hanging their noble heads, hoarding exotic burrs and seeds, and yet it is neither corn nor wheat that truly flourishes there, nor some jackalopian hybrid of the two. What grows in that place is possessed of a beauty all its own, ramshackle and unexpected, even in winter, when the wind hangs icicles from the skeletons of briars and small tracks cross the snow in search of forgotten grain; in the spring the little trickle of water swells to welcome frogs and minnows, a muskrat, a family of turtles, nesting doves in the verdant grass; in summer it is a thoroughfare for raccoons and opossums, field mice, swallows and black birds, migrating egrets, a passing fox; in autumn the geese avoid its abundance, seeking out windrows of toppled stalks, fatter grain more quickly discerned, more easily digested. Of those that travel the local road, few pay that fertile hollow any mind, even those with an eye for what blossoms, vetch and timothy, early forsythia, the fatted calf in the fallow field, the rabbit running for cover, the hawk's descent from the lightning-struck tree. You've passed this way yourself many times, and can tell me, if you would, do the formal fields end where the valley begins, or does everything that surrounds us emerge from its embrace?</p> "}, {"title": "Possum Crossing", "view_node": "/poem/possum-crossing", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/nikki-giovanni\" hreflang=\"und\">Nikki Giovanni</a>", "field_date_published": "2003", "body": " <pre>&#13;\nBacking out the driveway&#13;\nthe car lights cast an eerie glow&#13;\nin the morning fog centering&#13;\non movement in the rain slick street&#13;\n&#13;\nHitting brakes I anticipate a squirrel or a cat or sometimes&#13;\na little raccoon&#13;\nI once braked for a blind little mole who try though he did&#13;\ncould not escape the cat toying with his life&#13;\nMother-to-be possum occasionally lopes home . . . being&#13;\nnaturally . . . slow her condition makes her even more ginger&#13;\n&#13;\nWe need a sign POSSUM CROSSING to warn coffee-gurgling neighbors:&#13;\nwe share the streets with more than trucks and vans and&#13;\nrailroad crossings&#13;\n&#13;\nAll birds being the living kin of dinosaurs&#13;\nthink themselves invincible and pay no heed&#13;\nto the rolling wheels while they dine&#13;\non an unlucky rabbit&#13;\n&#13;\nI hit brakes for the flutter of the lights hoping it's not a deer&#13;\nor a skunk or a groundhog&#13;\ncoffee splashes over the cup which I quickly put away from me&#13;\nand into the empty passenger seat&#13;\nI look . . .&#13;\nrelieved and exasperated ...&#13;\nto discover I have just missed a big wet leaf&#13;\nstruggling . . . to lift itself into the wind&#13;\nand live</pre>&#13;\n "}, {"title": "Letter to Dr. B\u2014", "view_node": "/poem/letter-dr-b", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/diane-ackerman\" hreflang=\"und\">Diane Ackerman</a>", "field_date_published": "2003", "body": " <pre>&#13;\nI have found you among the texts&#13;\n(but not the textures) of your life,&#13;\nin the library of your cunning,&#13;\nwhere the abstracts of forty papers&#13;\nopen, one by one, like small windows&#13;\npartly sealed by terminology's lacquer.&#13;\nThey reveal you both aloof and enthralled,&#13;\na restless mind of intersecting planes.&#13;\n&#13;\nHow can I resist the paper \"Artist and Analyst\"?&#13;\nYet I do, thinking it best to stay&#13;\nwithin the frame we've chosen,&#13;\nusing the palette we invent,&#13;\ncreating a mosaic in motion.&#13;\nWhenever I set a shard in place,&#13;\nthe mosaic evolves, blurs a moment,&#13;\nthen a new scene refines, throwing past into relief,&#13;\ndrawing present into mind.&#13;\n&#13;\nSo I will sacrifice my yen to know&#13;\nthe what and whim of you.
