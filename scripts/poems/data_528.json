thee,\nThou boasted land of liberty,\u2014\nIt is to thee I raise my song,\nThou land of blood, and crime, and wrong.\nIt is to thee, my native land,\nFrom whence has issued many a band\nTo tear the black man from his soil,\nAnd force him here to delve and toil;\nChained on your blood-bemoistened sod,\nCringing beneath a tyrant's rod,\nStripped of those rights which Nature's God\n   Bequeathed to all the human race,\nBound to a petty tyrant's nod, \n   Because he wears a paler face.\nWas it for this, that freedom's fires\nWere kindled by your patriot sires?\nWas it for this, they shed their blood,\nOn hill and plain, on field and flood?\nWas it for this, that wealth and life\nWere staked upon that desperate strife,\nWhich drenched this land for seven long years\nWith blood of men, and women's tears?\nWhen black and white fought side by side, \n   Upon the well-contested field,\u2014\nTurned back the fierce opposing tide, \n   And made the proud invader yield\u2014\nWhen, wounded, side by side they lay, \n   And heard with joy the proud hurrah\nFrom their victorious comrades say \n   That they had waged successful war,\nThe thought ne'er entered in their brains\n   That they endured those toils and pains,\nTo forge fresh fetters, heavier chains\nFor their own children, in whose veins\nShould flow that patriotic blood,\nSo freely shed on field and flood.\nOh no; they fought, as they believed, \n   For the inherent rights of man;\nBut mark, how they have been deceived \n   By slavery's accursed plan.\nThey never thought, when thus they shed \n   Their heart's best blood, in freedom's cause\nThat their own sons would live in dread, \n   Under unjust, oppressive laws:\nThat those who quietly enjoyed \n   The rights for which they fought and fell,\nCould be the framers of a code, \n   That would disgrace the fiends of hell!\nCould they have looked, with prophet's ken, \n   Down to the present evil time, \n   Seen free-born men, uncharged with crime,\nConsigned unto a slaver's pen,\u2014\nOr thrust into a prison cell,\nWith thieves and murderers to dwell\u2014\nWhile that same flag whose stripes and stars\nHad been their guide through freedom's wars\nAs proudly waved above the pen\nOf dealers in the souls of men!\nOr could the shades of all the dead, \n   Who fell beneath that starry flag,\nVisit the scenes where they once bled, \n   On hill and plain, on vale and crag,\nBy peaceful brook, or ocean's strand, \n   By inland lake, or dark green wood,\nWhere'er the soil of this wide land \n   Was moistened by their patriot blood,\u2014\nAnd then survey the country o'er, \n   From north to south, from east to west,\nAnd hear the agonizing cry\nAscending up to God on high,\nFrom western wilds to ocean's shore, \n   The fervent prayer of the oppressed;\nThe cry of helpless infancy \n   Torn from the parent's fond caress\nBy some base tool of tyranny,\n   And doomed to woe and wretchedness;\nThe indignant wail of fiery youth, \n   Its noble aspirations crushed,\nIts generous zeal, its love of truth, \n   Trampled by tyrants in the dust;\nThe aerial piles which fancy reared, \n   And hopes too bright to be enjoyed,\nHave passed and left his young heart seared, \n   And all its dreams of bliss destroyed.\nThe shriek of virgin purity, \n   Doomed to some libertine's embrace,\nShould rouse the strongest sympathy \n   Of each one of the human race;\nAnd weak old age, oppressed with care, \n   As he reviews the scene of strife,\nPuts up to God a fervent prayer, \n   To close his dark and troubled life.\nThe cry of fathers, mothers, wives, \n   Severed from all their hearts hold dear,\nAnd doomed to spend their wretched lives \n   In gloom, and doubt, and hate, and fear;\nAnd manhood, too, with soul of fire,\nAnd arm of strength, and smothered ire,\nStands pondering with brow of gloom,\nUpon his dark unhappy doom,\nWhether to plunge in battle's strife,\nAnd buy his freedom with his life,\nAnd with stout heart and weapon strong,\nPay back the tyrant wrong for wrong,\nOr wait the promised time of God, \n   When his Almighty ire shall wake,\nAnd smite the oppressor in his wrath,\nAnd hurl red ruin in his path,\nAnd with the terrors of his rod, \n   Cause adamantine hearts to quake.\nHere Christian writhes in bondage still, \n   Beneath his brother Christian's rod,\nAnd pastors trample down at will, \n   The image of the living God.\nWhile prayers go up in lofty strains, \n   And pealing hymns ascend to heaven,\nThe captive, toiling in his chains, \n   With tortured limbs and bosom riven,\nRaises his fettered hand on high, \n   And in the accents of despair,\nTo him who rules both earth and sky, \n   Puts up a sad, a fervent prayer,\nTo free him from the awful blast \n   Of slavery's bitter galling shame\u2014\nAlthough his portion should be cast \n   With demons in eternal flame!\nAlmighty God! \u00c2t is this they call \n   The land of liberty and law;\nPart of its sons in baser thrall \n   Than Babylon or Egypt saw\u2014\nWorse scenes of rapine, lust and shame, \n   Than Babylonian ever knew,\nAre perpetrated in the name \n   Of God, the holy, just, and true;\nAnd darker doom than Egypt felt,\nMay yet repay this nation's guilt.\nAlmighty God! thy aid impart,\nAnd fire anew each faltering heart,\nAnd strengthen every patriot's hand,\nWho aims to save our native land.\nWe do not come before thy throne, \n   With carnal weapons drenched in gore,\nAlthough our blood has freely flown, \n   In adding to the tyrant's store.\nFather! before thy throne we come, \n   Not in the panoply of war,\nWith pealing trump, and rolling drum, \n   And cannon booming loud and far;\nStriving in blood to wash out blood, \n   Through wrong to seek redress for wrong;\nFor while thou 'rt holy, just and good, \n   The battle is not to the strong;\nBut in the sacred name of peace, \n   Of justice, virtue, love and truth,\nWe pray, and never mean to cease, \n   Till weak old age and fiery youth\nIn freedom's cause their voices raise,\nAnd burst the bonds of every slave;\nTill, north and south, and east and west,\nThe wrongs we bear shall be redressed.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Bible Defence of Slavery", "view_node": "/poem/bible-defence-slavery", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/frances-ellen-watkins-harper\" hreflang=\"und\">Frances Ellen
