\nAnd at a Knyght than wol I first bigynne. \n\n\nA Knyght ther was, and that a worthy man, \nThat fro the tyme that he first bigan \nTo riden out, he loved chivalrie, \nTrouthe and hon\u00f3ur, fredom and curteisie. \nFul worthy was he in his lordes werre, \nAnd thereto hadde he riden, no man ferre, \nAs wel in cristendom as in hethenesse, \nAnd evere hon\u00f3ured for his worthynesse. \nAt Alisaundre he was whan it was wonne; \nFul ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne \nAboven alle nacions in Pruce. \nIn Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,\u2014 \nNo cristen man so ofte of his degree. \nIn Gernade at the seege eek hadde he be \nOf Algezir, and riden in Belmarye. \nAt Lyeys was he, and at Satalye, \nWhan they were wonne; and in the Grete See \nAt many a noble armee hadde he be. \n\n\nAt mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene, \nAnd foughten for oure feith at Tramyssene \nIn lyste thries, and ay slayn his foo. \nThis ilke worthy knyght hadde been also \nSomtyme with the lord of Palatye \nAgayn another hethen in Turkye; \nAnd evermoore he hadde a sovereyn prys. \nAnd though that he were worthy, he was wys, \nAnd of his port as meeke as is a mayde. \nHe nevere yet no vileynye ne sayde, \nIn al his lyf, unto no maner wight. \nHe was a verray, parfit, gentil knyght. \n\n\nBut for to tellen yow of his array, \nHis hors weren goode, but he was nat gay; \nOf fustian he wered a gypon \nAl bism\u00f3tered with his habergeon; \nFor he was late y-come from his viage, \nAnd wente for to doon his pilgrymage. \n\n\nWith hym ther was his sone, a yong Squi\u00e9r, \nA lovyere and a lusty bacheler, \nWith lokkes crulle as they were leyd in presse. \nOf twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse. \nOf his stat\u00fare he was of evene lengthe, \nAnd wonderly delyvere and of greet strengthe. \nAnd he hadde been somtyme in chyvachie \nIn Flaundres, in Artoys, and Pycardie, \nAnd born hym weel, as of so litel space, \nIn hope to stonden in his lady grace. \nEmbrouded was he, as it were a meede \nAl ful of fresshe floures whyte and reede. \nSyngynge he was, or floytynge, al the day; \nHe was as fressh as is the month of May. \nShort was his gowne, with sleves longe and wyde; \nWel koude he sitte on hors and faire ryde; \nHe koude songes make and wel endite, \nJuste and eek daunce, and weel purtreye and write. \nSo hoote he lovede that by nyghtertale \nHe sleep namoore than dooth a nyghtyngale. \nCurteis he was, lowely and servys\u00e1ble, \nAnd carf biforn his fader at the table. \n\n\nA Yeman hadde he and serv\u00e1ntz namo \nAt that tyme, for hym liste ride soo; \nAnd he was clad in cote and hood of grene. \nA sheef of pecock arwes bright and kene, \nUnder his belt he bar ful thriftily\u2014 \nWel koude he dresse his takel yemanly; \nHis arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe\u2014 \nAnd in his hand he baar a myghty bowe. \nA not-heed hadde he, with a broun vis\u00e1ge. \nOf woodecraft wel koude he al the us\u00e1ge. \nUpon his arm he baar a gay brac\u00e9r, \nAnd by his syde a swerd and a bokeler, \nAnd on that oother syde a gay daggere, \nHarneised wel and sharp as point of spere; \nA Cristophere on his brest of silver sheene. \nAn horn he bar, the bawdryk was of grene. \nA forster was he, soothly as I gesse. \n\n\nTher was also a Nonne, a Prioresse, \nThat of hir smylyng was ful symple and coy; \nHire gretteste ooth was but by seinte Loy, \nAnd she was cleped madame Eglentyne. \nFul weel she soong the service dyvyne, \nEntuned in hir nose ful semely; \nAnd Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly, \nAfter the scole of Stratford atte Bowe, \nFor Frenssh of Parys was to hire unknowe. \nAt mete wel y-taught was she with-alle: \nShe leet no morsel from hir lippes falle, \nNe wette hir fyngres in hir sauce depe. \nWel koude she carie a morsel and wel kepe \nTh\u00e1t no drope ne fille upon hire brist; \nIn curteisie was set ful muchel hir list. \nHire over-lippe wyped she so clene \nThat in hir coppe ther was no ferthyng sene \nOf grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte. \nFul semely after hir mete she raughte. \nAnd sikerly she was of greet desport, \nAnd ful ples\u00e1unt and amyable of port, \nAnd peyned hire to countrefete cheere \nOf court, and been estatlich of manere, \nAnd to ben holden digne of reverence. \nBut for to speken of hire conscience, \nShe was so charitable and so pitous \nShe wolde wepe if that she saugh a mous \nKaught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde. \nOf smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde \nWith rosted flessh, or milk and wastel breed; \nBut soore wepte she if oon of hem were deed, \nOr if men smoot it with a yerde smerte; \nAnd al was conscience and tendre herte. \n\n\nFul semyly hir wympul pynched was; \nHire nose tretys, her eyen greye as glas, \nHir mouth ful smal and ther-to softe and reed; \nBut sikerly she hadde a fair forheed; \nIt was almoost a spanne brood, I trowe; \nFor, hardily, she was nat undergrowe. \nFul fetys was hir cloke, as I was war; \nOf smal coral aboute hire arm she bar \nA peire of bedes, gauded al with grene, \nAnd ther-on heng a brooch of gold ful sheene, \nOn which ther was first write a crowned A, \nAnd after, Amor vincit omnia. \n\n\nAnother Nonne with hire hadde she, \nThat was hire chapeleyne, and Preestes thre. \n\n\nA Monk ther was, a fair for the maistrie, \nAn outridere, that lovede venerie; \nA manly man, to been an abbot able. \nFul many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable; \nAnd whan he rood, men myghte his brydel heere \nG\u00fdnglen in a whistlynge wynd als cleere, \nAnd eek as loude, as dooth the chapel belle, \nTher as this lord was kepere of the celle. \nThe reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit, \nBy-cause that it was old and som-del streit,\u2014 \nThis ilke Monk leet olde thynges pace, \nAnd heeld after the newe world the space. \nHe yaf nat of that text a pulled hen \nThat seith that hunters ben nat hooly men, \nNe that a monk, whan he is recchelees, \nIs likned til a fissh that is waterlees,\u2014 \nThis is to seyn, a monk out of his cloystre. \nBut thilke text heeld he nat worth an oystre; \nAnd I seyde his opinioun was good. \nWhat sholde he studie and make hymselven wood, \nUpon a book in cloystre alwey to poure, \nOr swynken with his handes and lab\u00f3ure, \nAs Austyn bit? How shal the world be served? \nLat Austyn have his swynk to him reserved. \nTherfore he was a prikasour aright: \nGrehoundes he hadde, as swift as fowel in flight; \nOf prikyng and of huntyng for the hare \nWas al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare. \nI seigh his sleves y-p\u00farfiled at the hond \nWith grys, and that the fyneste of a lond; \nAnd for to festne his hood under his chyn \nHe hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pyn; \nA love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was. \nHis heed was balled, that shoon as any glas, \nAnd eek his face, as he hadde been enoynt. \nHe was a lord ful fat and in good poynt; \nHis eyen stepe, and rollynge in his heed, \nThat stemed as a forneys of a leed; \nHis bootes souple, his hors in greet estaat. \nNow certeinly he was a fair prelaat. \nHe was nat pale, as a forpyned goost: \nA fat swan loved he best of any roost. \nHis palfrey was as broun as is a berye. \n\n\nA Frere ther was, a wantowne and a merye, \nA lymytour, a ful sol\u00e9mpne man. \nIn alle the ordres foure is noon that kan \nSo muchel of daliaunce and fair langage. \nHe hadde maad ful many a mariage \nOf yonge wommen at his owene cost. \nUnto his ordre he was a noble post. \nFul wel biloved and famulier was he \nWith frankeleyns over al in his contree, \nAnd eek with worthy wommen of the toun; \nFor he hadde power of confessioun, \nAs seyde hym-self, moore than a cur\u00e1t, \nFor of his ordre he was licenciat. \nFul swetely herde he confessioun, \nAnd plesaunt was his absolucioun. \nHe was an esy man to yeve penaunce \nThere as he wiste to have a good pitaunce; \nFor unto a povre ordre for to yive \nIs signe that a man is wel y-shryve; \nFor, if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt \nHe wiste that a man was r\u00e9pentaunt; \nFor many a man so hard is of his herte \nHe may nat wepe al-thogh hym soore smerte. \nTherfore in stede of wepynge and prey\u00e9res \nMen moote yeve silver to the povre freres. \nHis typet was ay farsed full of knyves \nAnd pynnes, for to yeven faire wyves. \nAnd certeinly he hadde a murye note: \nWel koude he synge and pleyen on a rote; \nOf yeddynges he baar outrely the pris. \nHis nekke whit was as the flour-de-lys; \nTher-to he strong was as a champioun. \nHe knew the tavernes wel in every toun, \nAnd everich hostiler and tappestere \nBet than a lazar or a beggestere; \nFor unto swich a worthy man as he \nAcorded nat, as by his facultee, \nTo have with sike lazars aqueyntaunce; \nIt is nat honest, it may nat avaunce \nF\u00f3r to deelen with no swich poraille, \nBut al with riche and selleres of vitaille. \nAnd over-al, ther as profit sholde arise, \nCurteis he was and lowely of servyse. \nTher nas no man nowher so vertuous. \nHe was the beste beggere in his hous; \n[And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt, \nNoon of his brethren cam ther in his haunt;] \nFor thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho, \nSo plesaunt was his In principio, \nYet wolde he have a ferthyng er he wente: \nHis purchas was wel bettre than his rente. \nAnd rage he koude, as it were right a whelpe. \nIn love-dayes ther koude he muchel helpe, \nFor there he was nat lyk a cloysterer \nWith a thredbare cope, as is a povre scol\u00e9r, \nBut he was lyk a maister, or a pope; \nOf double worstede was his semycope, \nThat rounded as a belle, out of the presse. \nSomwhat he lipsed for his wantownesse, \nTo make his Englissh sweete upon his tonge; \nAnd in his harpyng, whan that he hadde songe, \nHis eyen twynkled in his heed aryght \nAs doon the sterres in the frosty nyght. \nThis worthy lymytour was cleped Hub\u00e9rd. \n\n\nA Marchant was ther with a forked berd, \nIn motteleye, and hye on horse he sat; \nUpon his heed a Flaundryssh bevere hat; \nHis bootes clasped faire and fetisly. \nHis resons he spak ful sol\u00e9mpnely, \nSownynge alway thencrees of his wynnyng. \nHe wolde the see were kept for any thing \nBitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle. \nWel koude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle. \nThis worthy man ful wel his wit bisette; \nTher wiste no wight that he was in dette, \nSo estatly was he of his gouvernaunce, \nWith his bargaynes and with his chevyssaunce. \nFor sothe he was a worthy man with-alle, \nBut, sooth to seyn, I noot how men hym calle. \n\n\nA Clerk ther was of Oxenford also, \nThat unto logyk hadde longe y-go. \nAs leene was his hors as is a rake, \nAnd he nas nat right fat, I undertake, \nBut looked holwe, and ther-to sobrely. \nFul thredbare was his overeste courtepy; \nFor he hadde geten hym yet no benefice, \nNe was so worldly for to have office; \nFor hym was l\u00e9vere h\u00e1ve at his beddes heed \nTw\u00e9nty bookes, clad in blak or reed, \nOf Aristotle and his philosophie, \nThan robes riche, or f\u00edthele, or gay sautrie. \nBut al be that he was a philosophre, \nYet hadde he but litel gold in cofre; \nBut al that he myghte of his freendes hente \nOn bookes and on lernynge he it spente, \nAnd bisily gan for the soules preye \nOf hem that yaf hym wher-with to scoleye. \nOf studie took he moost cure and moost heede. \nNoght o word spak he moore than was neede; \nAnd that was seyd in forme and reverence, \nAnd short and quyk and ful of hy sent\u00e9nce. \nSownynge in moral vertu was his speche; \nAnd gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche. \n\n\nA Sergeant of the Lawe, war and wys, \nThat often hadde been at the Parvys, \nTher was also, ful riche of excellence. \nDiscreet he was, and of greet reverence\u2014 \nHe semed swich, his wordes weren so wise. \nJustice he was ful often in assise, \nBy patente, and by pleyn commissioun. \nFor his science and for his heigh renoun, \nOf fees and robes hadde he many oon. \nSo greet a purchasour was nowher noon: \nAl was fee symple to hym in effect; \nHis purchasyng myghte nat been infect. \nNowher so bisy a man as he ther nas, \nAnd yet he semed bisier than he was. \nIn termes hadde he caas and doomes alle \nThat from the tyme of kyng William were falle. \nTher-to he koude endite and make a thyng, \nTher koude no wight pynche at his writyng; \nAnd every statut koude he pleyn by rote. \nHe rood but hoomly in a medlee cote, \nGirt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale; \nOf his array telle I no lenger tale. \n\n\nA Frankeleyn was in his compaignye. \nWhit was his berd as is the dayesye; \nOf his complexioun he was sangwyn. \nWel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn; \nTo lyven in delit was evere his wone, \nFor he was Epicurus owene sone, \nThat heeld opinioun that pleyn delit \nWas verraily felicitee parfit. \nAn housholdere, and that a greet, was he; \nSeint Julian he was in his contree. \nHis breed, his ale, was alweys after oon; \nA bettre envyned man was nowher noon. \nWithoute bake mete was nevere his hous, \nOf fissh and flessh, and that so plentevous, \nIt snewed in his hous of mete and drynke, \nOf alle deyntees that men koude thynke, \nAfter the sondry sesons of the yeer; \nSo chaunged he his mete and his soper. \nFul many a fat partrich hadde he in muwe, \nAnd many a breem and many a luce in stuwe. \nWo was his cook but if his sauce were \nPoynaunt and sharp, and redy al his geere. \nHis table dormant in his halle alway \nStood redy covered al the longe day. \nAt sessiouns ther was he lord and sire; \nFul ofte tyme he was knyght of the shire. \nAn anlaas, and a gipser al of silk, \nHeeng at his girdel, whit as morne milk. \nA shirreve hadde he been, and a countour; \nWas nowher such a worthy vavasour. \n\n\nAn Haberdasshere, and a Carpenter, \nA Webbe, a Dyere, and a Tapycer,\u2014 \nAnd they were clothed alle in o lyveree \nOf a sol\u00e9mpne and a greet fraternitee. \nFul fressh and newe hir geere apiked was; \nHir knyves were chaped noght with bras, \nBut al with silver; wroght ful clene and weel \nHire girdles and hir pouches everydeel. \nWel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys \nTo sitten in a yeldehalle, on a deys. \n\u00c9verich, for the wisdom that he kan, \nWas shaply for to been an alderman; \nFor catel hadde they ynogh and rente, \nAnd eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente, \nAnd elles certeyn were they to blame. \nIt is ful fair to been y-cleped Madame, \nAnd goon to vigilies al bifore, \nAnd have a mantel roialliche y-bore. \n\n\nA Cook they hadde with hem for the nones, \nTo boille the chiknes with the marybones, \nAnd poudre-marchant tart, and galyngale. \nWel koude he knowe a draughte of Londoun ale. \nHe koude rooste, and sethe, and broille, and frye, \nM\u00e1ken mortreux, and wel bake a pye. \nBut greet harm was it, as it thoughte me, \nThat on his shyne a mormal hadde he; \nFor blankmanger, that made he with the beste. \n\n\nA Shipman was ther, wonynge fer by weste; \nFor aught I woot he was of Dertemouthe. \nHe rood upon a rouncy, as he kouthe, \nIn a gowne of faldyng to the knee. \nA daggere hangynge on a laas hadde he \nAboute his nekke, under his arm adoun. \nThe hoote somer hadde maad his hewe al broun; \nAnd certeinly he was a good felawe. \nFul many a draughte of wyn hadde he y-drawe \nFro Burdeux-ward, whil that the chapman sleep. \nOf nyce conscience took he no keep. \nIf that he faught and hadde the hyer hond, \nBy water he sente hem hoom to every lond. \nBut of his craft to rekene wel his tydes, \nHis stremes, and his daungers hym bisides, \nHis herberwe and his moone, his lode-menage, \nTher nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage. \nHardy he was and wys to undertake; \nWith many a tempest hadde his berd been shake. \nHe knew alle the havenes, as they were, \nFrom Gootlond to the Cape of Fynystere, \nAnd every cryke in Britaigne and in Spayne. \nHis barge y-cleped was the Maudelayne. \n\n\nWith us ther was a Doctour of Phisik; \nIn all this world ne was ther noon hym lik, \nTo speke of phisik and of surgerye; \nFor he was grounded in astronomye. \nHe kepte his pacient a ful greet deel \nIn houres, by his magyk natureel. \nWel koude he fortunen the ascendent \nOf his ym\u00e1ges for his pacient. \nHe knew the cause of everich maladye, \nWere it of hoot, or cold, or moyste, or drye, \nAnd where they engendred and of what humour. \nHe was a verray, parfit praktisour; \nThe cause y-knowe, and of his harm the roote, \nAnon he yaf the sike man his boote. \nFul redy hadde he his apothecaries \nTo sende him drogges and his letuaries; \nFor ech of hem made oother for to wynne, \nHir frendshipe nas nat newe to bigynne. \nWel knew he the olde Esculapius, \nAnd De{\"y}scorides, and eek Rufus, \nOld Ypocras, Haly, and Galyen, \nSerapion, Razis, and Avycen, \nAverrois, Damascien, and Constantyn, \nBernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn. \nOf his diete mesurable was he, \nFor it was of no superfluitee, \nBut of greet norissyng and digest\u00edble. \nHis studie was but litel on the Bible. \nIn sangwyn and in pers he clad was al, \nLyned with taffata and with sendal. \nAnd yet he was but esy of dispence; \nHe kepte that he wan in pestilence. \nFor gold in phisik is a cordial; \nTherfore he lovede gold in special. \n\n\nA Good Wif was ther of biside Bathe, \nBut she was som-del deef, and that was scathe. \nOf clooth-makyng she hadde swich an haunt \nShe passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt. \nIn al the parisshe wif ne was ther noon \nThat to the offrynge bifore hire sholde goon; \nAnd if ther dide, certeyn so wrooth was she \nThat she was out of alle charitee. \nHir coverchiefs ful fyne weren of ground; \nI dorste swere they weyeden ten pound \nThat on a Sonday weren upon hir heed. \nHir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed, \nFul streite y-teyd, and shoes ful moyste and newe. \nBoold was hir face, and fair, and reed of hewe. \nShe was a worthy womman al hir lyve; \nHousbondes at chirche dore she hadde fyve, \nWithouten oother compaignye in youthe; \nBut ther-of nedeth nat to speke as nowthe. \nAnd thries hadde she been at J\u00e9rusalem; \nShe hadde passed many a straunge strem; \nAt Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne, \nIn Galice at Seint Jame, and at Coloigne. \nShe koude muchel of wandrynge by the weye. \nGat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye. \nUpon an amblere esily she sat, \nY-wympled wel, and on hir heed an hat \nAs brood as is a bokeler or a targe; \nA foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large, \nAnd on hire feet a paire of spores sharpe. \nIn felaweshipe wel koude she laughe and carpe; \nOf remedies of love she knew per chaunc\u00e9, \nFor she koude of that art the olde daunce. \n\n\nA good man was ther of religioun, \nAnd was a povre Person of a Toun; \nBut riche he was of hooly thoght and werk. \nHe was also a lerned man, a clerk, \nThat Cristes Gospel trewely wolde preche; \nHis parisshens devoutly wolde he teche. \nBenygne he was, and wonder diligent, \nAnd in adversitee ful pacient; \nAnd swich he was y-preved ofte sithes. \nFul looth were hym to cursen for his tithes, \nBut rather wolde he yeven, out of doute, \nUnto his povre parisshens aboute, \nOf his offr\u00fdng and eek of his substaunce; \nHe koude in litel thyng have suffisaunce. \nWyd was his parisshe, and houses fer asonder, \nBut he ne lafte nat, for reyn ne thonder, \nIn siknesse nor in meschief to vis\u00edte \nThe ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lite, \nUpon his feet, and in his hand a staf. \nThis noble ensample to his sheep he yaf, \nThat first he wroghte and afterward he taughte. \nOut of the gospel he tho wordes caughte; \nAnd this figure he added eek therto, \nThat if gold ruste, what shal iren doo? \nFor if a preest be foul, on whom we truste, \nNo wonder is a lewed man to ruste; \nAnd shame it is, if a prest take keep, \nA shiten shepherde and a clene sheep. \nWel oghte a preest ensample for to yive \nBy his clennesse how that his sheep sholde lyve. \nHe sette nat his benefice to hyre \nAnd leet his sheep encombred in the myre, \nAnd ran to Londoun, unto Seinte Poules, \nTo seken hym a chaunterie for soules, \nOr with a bretherhed to been withholde; \nBut dwelte at hoom and kepte wel his folde, \nSo that the wolf ne made it nat myscarie; \nHe was a shepherde, and noght a mercenarie. \nAnd though he hooly were and vertuous, \nHe was to synful man nat despitous, \nNe of his speche daungerous ne digne, \nBut in his techyng d\u00edscreet and benygne. \nTo drawen folk to hevene by fairnesse, \nBy good ensample, this was his bisynesse. \nBut it were any persone obstinat, \nWhat so he were, of heigh or lough estat, \nHym wolde he snybben sharply for the nonys. \nA bettre preest I trowe that nowher noon ys. \nHe waited after no pompe and reverence, \nNe maked him a spiced conscience; \nBut Cristes loore and his apostles twelve \nHe taughte, but first he folwed it hymselve. \n\n\nWith hym ther was a Plowman, was his brother, \nThat hadde y-lad of dong ful many a fother; \nA trewe swynkere and a good was he, \nLyvynge in pees and parfit charitee. \nGod loved he best, with al his hoole herte, \nAt alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte. \nAnd thanne his neighebor right as hymselve. \nHe wolde thresshe, and therto dyke and delve, \nFor Cristes sake, for every povre wight, \nWithouten hire, if it lay in his myght. \nHis tithes payede he ful faire and wel, \nBothe of his propre swynk and his catel. \nIn a tabard he rood upon a mere. \n\n\nTher was also a Reve and a Millere, \nA Somnour and a Pardoner also, \nA Maunciple, and myself,\u2014ther were namo. \n\n\nThe Millere was a stout carl for the nones; \nFul byg he was of brawn and eek of bones. \nThat proved wel, for over-al, ther he cam, \nAt wrastlynge he wolde have alwey the ram. \nHe was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre; \nTher nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre, \nOr breke it at a rennyng with his heed. \nHis berd as any sowe or fox was reed, \nAnd therto brood, as though it were a spade. \nUpon the cop right of his nose he hade \nA werte, and thereon stood a toft of herys, \nReed as the brustles of a sowes erys; \nHis nosethirles blake were and wyde. \nA swerd and a bokeler bar he by his syde. \nHis mouth as greet was as a greet forneys; \nHe was a janglere and a goliardeys, \nAnd that was moost of synne and harlotries. \nWel koude he stelen corn and tollen thries; \nAnd yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee. \nA whit cote and a blew hood wered he. \nA baggepipe wel koude he blowe and sowne, \nAnd therwithal he broghte us out of towne. \n\n\nA gentil Maunciple was ther of a temple, \nOf which ach\u00e1tours myghte take exemple \nFor to be wise in byynge of vitaille; \nFor, wheither that he payde or took by taille, \nAlgate he wayted so in his achaat \nThat he was ay biforn and in good staat. \nNow is nat that of God a ful fair grace, \nThat swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace \nThe wisdom of an heep of lerned men? \nOf maistres hadde he mo than thries ten, \nThat weren of lawe expert and curious, \nOf whiche ther weren a duszeyne in that hous \nWorthy to been stywardes of rente and lond \nOf any lord that is in Engelond, \nTo maken hym lyve by his propre good, \nIn honour dettelees, but if he were wood, \nOr lyve as scarsly as hym list desire; \nAnd able for to helpen al a shire \nIn any caas that myghte falle or happe; \nAnd yet this Manciple sette hir aller cappe \n\n\nThe Reve was a sclendre colerik man. \nHis berd was shave as ny as ever he kan; \nHis heer was by his erys round y-shorn; \nHis top was dokked lyk a preest biforn. \nFul longe were his legges and ful lene, \nY-lyk a staf, ther was no calf y-sene. \nWel koude he kepe a gerner and a bynne; \nTher was noon auditour koude on him wynne. \nWel wiste he, by the droghte and by the reyn, \nThe yeldynge of his seed and of his greyn. \nHis lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye, \nHis swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultrye, \nWas hoolly in this reves governyng; \nAnd by his covenant yaf the rekenyng \nSyn that his lord was twenty yeer of age; \nThere koude no man brynge hym in arrerage. \nThere nas baillif, ne hierde, nor oother hyne, \nThat he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne; \nThey were adrad of hym as of the deeth. \nHis wonyng was ful fair upon an heeth; \nWith grene trees shadwed was his place. \nHe koude bettre than his lord purchace; \nFul riche he was a-stored pryvely. \nHis lord wel koude he plesen subtilly, \nTo yeve and lene hym of his owene good, \nAnd have a thank, and yet a cote and hood. \nIn youthe he hadde lerned a good myster; \nHe was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter. \nThis Reve sat upon a ful good stot, \nThat was al pomely grey, and highte Scot. \nA long surcote of pers upon he hade, \nAnd by his syde he baar a rusty blade. \nOf Northfolk was this Reve of which I telle, \nBiside a toun men clepen Baldeswelle. \nTukked he was as is a frere, aboute. \nAnd evere he rood the hyndreste of oure route. \n\n\nA Somonour was ther with us in that place, \nThat hadde a fyr-reed cherubynnes face, \nFor sawcefleem he was, with eyen narwe. \nAs hoot he was and lecherous as a sparwe, \nWith scaled browes blake and piled berd,\u2014 \nOf his visage children were aferd. \nTher nas quyk-silver, lytarge, ne brymstoon, \nBoras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon, \nNe oynement that wolde clense and byte, \nThat hym myghte helpen of his whelkes white, \nNor of the knobbes sittynge on his chekes. \nWel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes, \nAnd for to drynken strong wyn, reed as blood. \nThanne wolde he speke, and crie as he were wood. \nAnd whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn, \nThan wolde he speke no word but Latyn. \nA fewe termes hadde he, two or thre, \nThat he had lerned out of som decree,\u2014 \nNo wonder is, he herde it al the day; \nAnd eek ye knowen wel how that a jay \nKan clepen \"Watte\" as wel as kan the pope. \nBut whoso koude in oother thyng hym grope, \nThanne hadde he spent al his philosophie; \nAy \"Questio quid juris\" wolde he crie. \nHe was a gentil harlot and a kynde; \nA bettre felawe sholde men noght fynde. \nHe wolde suffre for a quart of wyn \nA good felawe to have his concubyn \nA twelf month, and excuse hym atte fulle; \nAnd prively a fynch eek koude he pulle. \nAnd if he foond owher a good felawe, \nHe wolde techen him to have noon awe, \nIn swich caas, of the erchedekenes curs, \nBut if a mannes soule were in his purs; \nFor in his purs he sholde y-punysshed be: \n\"Purs is the erchedekenes helle,\" seyde he. \nBut wel I woot he lyed right in dede. \nOf cursyng oghte ech gilty man him drede, \nFor curs wol slee, right as assoillyng savith; \nAnd also war him of a Significavit. \nIn daunger hadde he at his owene gise \nThe yonge girles of the diocise, \nAnd knew hir conseil, and was al hir reed. \nA gerland hadde he set upon his heed, \nAs greet as it were for an ale-stake; \nA bokeleer hadde he maad him of a cake. \n\n\nWith hym ther rood a gentil Pardoner \nOf Rouncivale, his freend and his compeer, \nThat streight was comen fro the court of Rome. \nFul loude he soong, \"Com hider, love, to me!\" \nThis Somonour bar to hym a stif burdoun; \nWas nevere trompe of half so greet a soun. \nThis Pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex, \nBut smothe it heeng as dooth a strike of flex; \nBy ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde, \nAnd therwith he his shuldres overspradde. \nBut thynne it lay, by colpons, oon and oon; \nBut hood, for jolitee, wered he noon, \nFor it was trussed up in his wal\u00e9t. \nHym thoughte he rood al of the newe jet; \nDischevelee, save his cappe, he rood al bare. \nSwiche glarynge eyen hadde he as an hare. \nA vernycle hadde he sowed upon his cappe. \nHis walet lay biforn hym in his lappe, \nBret-ful of pardoun, comen from Rome al hoot. \nA voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot. \nNo berd hadde he, ne nevere sholde have, \nAs smothe it was as it were late y-shave; \nI trowe he were a geldyng or a mare. \nBut of his craft, fro Berwyk into Ware, \nNe was ther swich another pardoner; \nFor in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer, \nWhich that, he seyde, was Oure Lady veyl; \nHe seyde he hadde a gobet of the seyl \nThat Seinte Peter hadde, whan that he wente \nUpon the see, til Jesu Crist hym hente. \nHe hadde a croys of latoun, ful of stones, \nAnd in a glas he hadde pigges bones. \nBut with thise relikes, whan that he fond \nA povre person dwellynge upon lond, \nUpon a day he gat hym moore moneye \nThan that the person gat in monthes tweye; \nAnd thus with feyned flaterye and japes \nHe made the person and the peple his apes. \nBut trewely to tellen atte laste, \nHe was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste; \nWel koude he rede a lessoun or a storie, \nBut alderbest he song an offertorie; \nFor wel he wiste, whan that song was songe, \nHe moste preche, and wel affile his tonge \nTo wynne silver, as he ful wel koude; \nTherefore he song the murierly and loude. \n\n\nNow have I toold you shortly, in a clause, \nThestaat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the cause \nWhy that assembled was this compaignye \nIn Southwerk, at this gentil hostelrye \nThat highte the Tabard, faste by the Belle. \nBut now is tyme to yow for to telle \nHow that we baren us that ilke nyght, \nWhan we were in that hostelrie alyght; \nAnd after wol I telle of our viage \nAnd al the remenaunt of oure pilgrimage. \n\n\nBut first, I pray yow, of youre curteisye, \nThat ye narette it nat my vileynye, \nThogh that I pleynly speke in this mateere, \nTo telle yow hir wordes and hir cheere, \nNe thogh I speke hir wordes proprely. \nFor this ye knowen al-so wel as I, \nWhoso shal telle a tale after a man, \nHe moot reherce, as ny as evere he kan, \nEverich a word, if it be in his charge, \nAl speke he never so rudeliche and large; \nOr ellis he moot telle his tale untrewe, \nOr feyne thyng, or fynde wordes newe. \nHe may nat spare, althogh he were his brother; \nHe moot as wel seye o word as another. \nCrist spak hymself ful brode in hooly writ, \nAnd wel ye woot no vileynye is it. \nEek Plato seith, whoso kan hym rede, \n\"The wordes moote be cosyn to the dede.\" \n\n\nAlso I prey yow to foryeve it me, \nAl have I nat set folk in hir degree \nHeere in this tale, as that they sholde stonde; \nMy wit is short, ye may wel understonde. \n\n\nGreet chiere made oure Hoost us everichon, \nAnd to the soper sette he us anon, \nAnd served us with vitaille at the beste: \nStrong was the wyn and wel to drynke us leste. \n\n\nA semely man Oure Hooste was with-alle \nFor to been a marchal in an halle. \nA large man he was with eyen stepe, \nA fairer burgeys was ther noon in Chepe; \nBoold of his speche, and wys, and well y-taught, \nAnd of manhod hym lakkede right naught. \nEek thereto he was right a myrie man, \nAnd after soper pleyen he bigan, \nAnd spak of myrthe amonges othere thynges, \nWhan that we hadde maad our rekenynges; \nAnd seyde thus: \"Now, lordynges, trewely, \nYe been to me right welcome, hertely; \nFor by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye, \nI saugh nat this yeer so myrie a compaignye \nAt ones in this herberwe as is now. \nFayn wolde I doon yow myrthe, wiste I how; \nAnd of a myrthe I am right now bythoght, \nTo doon yow ese, and it shal coste noght. \n\n\n\"Ye goon to Canterbury\u2014God yow speede, \nThe blisful martir quite yow youre meede! \nAnd wel I woot, as ye goon by the weye, \nYe shapen yow to talen and to pleye; \nFor trewely confort ne myrthe is noon \nTo ride by the weye doumb as a stoon; \nAnd therfore wol I maken yow disport, \nAs I seyde erst, and doon yow som confort. \nAnd if you liketh alle, by oon assent, \nFor to stonden at my juggement, \nAnd for to werken as I shal yow seye, \nTo-morwe, whan ye riden by the weye, \nNow, by my fader soule, that is deed, \nBut ye be myrie, I wol yeve yow myn heed! \nHoold up youre hond, withouten moore speche.\" \n\n\nOure conseil was nat longe for to seche; \nUs thoughte it was noght worth to make it wys, \nAnd graunted hym withouten moore avys, \nAnd bad him seye his verdit, as hym leste. \n\n\n\"Lordynges,\" quod he, \"now herkneth for the beste; \nBut taak it nought, I prey yow, in desdeyn; \nThis is the poynt, to speken short and pleyn, \nThat ech of yow, to shorte with oure weye \nIn this viage, shal telle tales tweye, \nTo Caunterbury-ward, I mene it so, \nAnd homward he shal tellen othere two, \nOf avent\u00fares that whilom han bifalle. \nAnd which of yow that bereth hym beste of alle, \nThat is to seyn, that telleth in this caas \nTales of best sentence and moost solaas, \nShal have a soper at oure aller cost, \nHeere in this place, sittynge by this post, \nWhan that we come agayn fro Caunterbury. \nAnd, for to make yow the moore mury, \nI wol myselven gladly with yow ryde, \nRight at myn owene cost, and be youre gyde; \nAnd whoso wole my juggement withseye \nShal paye al that we spenden by the weye. \nAnd if ye vouche-sauf that it be so, \nTel me anon, withouten wordes mo, \nAnd I wol erly shape me therfore.\" \n\n\nThis thyng was graunted, and oure othes swore \nWith ful glad herte, and preyden hym also \nThat he wolde vouche-sauf for to do so, \nAnd that he wolde been oure governour, \nAnd of our tales juge and r\u00e9portour, \nAnd sette a soper at a certeyn pris; \nAnd we wol reuled been at his devys \nIn heigh and lough; and thus, by oon assent, \nWe been acorded to his juggement. \nAnd therupon the wyn was fet anon; \nWe dronken, and to reste wente echon, \nWithouten any lenger taryynge. \n\n\nAmorwe, whan that day gan for to sprynge, \nUp roos oure Hoost and was oure aller cok, \nAnd gadrede us togidre alle in a flok;
