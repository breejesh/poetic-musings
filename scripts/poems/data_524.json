\nFor this could never have been; and never, \n      Though the gods and the years relent, shall be. \n\n\nIs it worth a tear, is it worth an hour, \n      To think of things that are well outworn? \nOf fruitless husk and fugitive flower, \n      The dream foregone and the deed forborne? \nThough joy be done with and grief be vain, \nTime shall not sever us wholly in twain; \nEarth is not spoilt for a single shower; \n      But the rain has ruined the ungrown corn. \n\n\nIt will grow not again, this fruit of my heart, \n      Smitten with sunbeams, ruined with rain. \nThe singing seasons divide and depart, \n      Winter and summer depart in twain. \nIt will grow not again, it is ruined at root, \nThe bloodlike blossom, the dull red fruit; \nThough the heart yet sickens, the lips yet smart, \n      With sullen savour of poisonous pain. \n\n\nI have given no man of my fruit to eat; \n      I trod the grapes, I have drunken the wine. \nHad you eaten and drunken and found it sweet, \n      This wild new growth of the corn and vine, \nThis wine and bread without lees or leaven, \nWe had grown as gods, as the gods in heaven, \nSouls fair to look upon, goodly to greet, \n      One splendid spirit, your soul and mine. \n\n\nIn the change of years, in the coil of things, \n      In the clamour and rumour of life to be, \nWe, drinking love at the furthest springs, \n      Covered with love as a covering tree, \nWe had grown as gods, as the gods above, \nFilled from the heart to the lips with love, \nHeld fast in his hands, clothed warm with his wings, \n      O love, my love, had you loved but me! \n\n\nWe had stood as the sure stars stand, and moved \n      As the moon moves, loving the world; and seen \nGrief collapse as a thing disproved, \n      Death consume as a thing unclean. \nTwain halves of a perfect heart, made fast \nSoul to soul while the years fell past; \nHad you loved me once, as you have not loved; \n      Had the chance been with us that has not been. \n\n\nI have put my days and dreams out of mind, \n      Days that are over, dreams that are done. \nThough we seek life through, we shall surely find \n      There is none of them clear to us now, not one. \nBut clear are these things; the grass and the sand, \nWhere, sure as the eyes reach, ever at hand, \nWith lips wide open and face burnt blind, \n      The strong sea-daisies feast on the sun. \n\n\nThe low downs lean to the sea; the stream, \n      One loose thin pulseless tremulous vein, \nRapid and vivid and dumb as a dream, \n      Works downward, sick of the sun and the rain; \nNo wind is rough with the rank rare flowers; \nThe sweet sea, mother of loves and hours, \nShudders and shines as the grey winds gleam, \n      Turning her smile to a fugitive pain. \n\n\nMother of loves that are swift to fade, \n      Mother of mutable winds and hours. \nA barren mother, a mother-maid, \n      Cold and clean as her faint salt flowers. \nI would we twain were even as she, \nLost in the night and the light of the sea, \nWhere faint sounds falter and wan beams wade, \n      Break, and are broken, and shed into showers. \n\n\nThe loves and hours of the life of a man, \n      They are swift and sad, being born of the sea. \nHours that rejoice and regret for a span, \n      Born with a man's breath, mortal as he; \nLoves that are lost ere they come to birth, \nWeeds of the wave, without fruit upon earth. \nI lose what I long for, save what I can, \n      My love, my love, and no love for me! \n\n\nIt is not much that a man can save \n      On the sands of life, in the straits of time, \nWho swims in sight of the great third wave \n      That never a swimmer shall cross or climb. \nSome waif washed up with the strays and spars \nThat ebb-tide shows to the shore and the stars; \nWeed from the water, grass from a grave, \n      A broken blossom, a ruined rhyme. \n\n\nThere will no man do for your sake, I think, \n      What I would have done for the least word said. \nI had wrung life dry for your lips to drink, \n      Broken it up for your daily bread: \nBody for body and blood for blood, \nAs the flow of the full sea risen to flood \nThat yearns and trembles before it sink, \n      I had given, and lain down for you, glad and dead. \n\n\nYea, hope at highest and all her fruit, \n      And time at fullest and all his dower, \nI had given you surely, and life to boot, \n      Were we once made one for a single hour. \nBut now, you are twain, you are cloven apart, \nFlesh of his flesh, but heart of my heart; \nAnd deep in one is the bitter root, \n      And sweet for one is the lifelong flower. \n\n\nTo have died if you cared I should die for you, clung \n      To my life if you bade me, played my part \nAs it pleased you \u2014 these were the thoughts that stung, \n      The dreams that smote with a keener dart \nThan shafts of love or arrows of death; \nThese were but as fire is, dust, or breath, \nOr poisonous foam on the tender tongue \n      Of the little snakes that eat my heart. \n\n\nI wish we were dead together to-day, \n      Lost sight of, hidden away out of sight, \nClasped and clothed in the cloven clay, \n      Out of the world's way, out of the light, \nOut of the ages of worldly weather, \nForgotten of all men altogether, \nAs the world's first dead, taken wholly away, \n      Made one with death, filled full of the night. \n\n\nHow we should slumber, how we should sleep, \n      Far in the dark with the dreams and the dews! \nAnd dreaming, grow to each other, and weep, \n      Laugh low, live softly, murmur and muse; \nYea, and it may be, struck through by the dream, \nFeel the dust quicken and quiver, and seem \nAlive as of old to the lips, and leap \n      Spirit to spirit as lovers use. \n\n\nSick dreams and sad of a dull delight; \n      For what shall it profit when men are dead \nTo have dreamed, to have loved with the whole soul's might, \n      To have looked for day when the day was fled? \nLet come what will, there is one thing worth, \nTo have had fair love in the life upon earth: \nTo have held love safe till the day grew night, \n      While skies had colour and lips were red. \n\n\nWould I lose you now? would I take you then, \n      If I lose you now that my heart has need? \nAnd come what may after death to men, \n      What thing worth this will the dead years breed? \nLose life, lose all; but at least I know, \nO sweet life's love, having loved you so, \nHad I reached you on earth, I should lose not again, \n      In death nor life, nor in dream or deed. \n\n\nYea, I know this well: were you once sealed mine, \n      Mine in the blood's beat, mine in the breath, \nMixed into me as honey in wine, \n      Not time, that sayeth and gainsayeth, \nNor all strong things had severed us then; \nNot wrath of gods, nor wisdom of men, \nNor all things earthly, nor all divine, \n      Nor joy nor sorrow, nor life nor death. \n\n\nI had grown pure as the dawn and the dew, \n      You had grown strong as the sun or the sea. \nBut none shall triumph a whole life through: \n      For death is one, and the fates are three. \nAt the door of life, by the gate of breath, \nThere are worse things waiting for men than death; \nDeath could not sever my soul and you, \n      As these have severed your soul from me. \n\n\nYou have chosen and clung to the chance they sent you, \n      Life sweet as perfume and pure as prayer. \nBut will it not one day in heaven repent you? \n      Will they solace you wholly, the days that were? \nWill you lift up your eyes between sadness and bliss, \nMeet mine, and see where the great love is, \nAnd tremble and turn and be changed? Content you; \n      The gate is strait; I shall not be there. \n\n\nBut you, had you chosen, had you stretched hand, \n      Had you seen good such a thing were done, \nI too might have stood with the souls that stand \n      In the sun's sight, clothed with the light of the sun; \nBut who now on earth need care how I live? \nHave the high gods anything left to give, \nSave dust and laurels and gold and sand? \n      Which gifts are goodly; but I will none. \n\n\nO all fair lovers about the world, \n      There is none of you, none, that shall comfort me. \nMy thoughts are as dead things, wrecked and whirled \n      Round and round in a gulf of the sea; \nAnd still, through the sound and the straining stream, \nThrough the coil and chafe, they gleam in a dream, \nThe bright fine lips so cruelly curled, \n      And strange swift eyes where the soul sits free. \n\n\nFree, without pity, withheld from woe, \n      Ignorant; fair as the eyes are fair. \nWould I have you change now, change at a blow, \n      Startled and stricken, awake and aware? \nYea, if I could, would I have you see \nMy very love of you filling me, \nAnd know my soul to the quick, as I know \n      The likeness and look of your throat and hair? \n\n\nI shall not change you. Nay, though I might, \n      Would I change my sweet one love with a word? \nI had rather your hair should change in a night, \n      Clear now as the plume of a black bright bird; \nYour face fail suddenly, cease, turn grey, \nDie as a leaf that dies in a day. \nI will keep my soul in a place out of sight, \n      Far off, where the pulse of it is not heard. \n\n\nFar off it walks, in a bleak blown space, \n      Full of the sound of the sorrow of years. \nI have woven a veil for the weeping face, \n      Whose lips have drunken the wine of tears; \nI have found a way for the failing feet, \nA place for slumber and sorrow to meet; \nThere is no rumour about the place, \n      Nor light, nor any that sees or hears. \n\n\nI have hidden my soul out of sight, and said \n      \"Let none take pity upon thee, none \nComfort thy crying: for lo, thou art dead, \n      Lie still now, safe out of sight of the sun. \nHave I not built thee a grave, and wrought \nThy grave-clothes on thee of grievous thought, \nWith soft spun verses and tears unshed, \n      And sweet light visions of things undone? \n\n\n\"I have given thee garments and balm and myrrh, \n      And gold, and beautiful burial things. \nBut thou, be at peace now, make no stir; \n      Is not thy grave as a royal king's? \nFret not thyself though the end were sore; \nSleep, be patient, vex me no more. \nSleep; what hast thou to do with her? \n      The eyes that weep, with the mouth that sings?\" \n\n\nWhere the dead red leaves of the years lie rotten, \n      The cold old crimes and the deeds thrown by, \nThe misconceived and the misbegotten, \n      I would find a sin to do ere I die, \nSure to dissolve and destroy me all through, \nThat would set you higher in heaven, serve you \nAnd leave you happy, when clean forgotten, \n      As a dead man out of mind, am I. \n\n\nYour lithe hands draw me, your face burns through me, \n      I am swift to follow you, keen to see; \nBut love lacks might to redeem or undo me; \n      As I have been, I know I shall surely be; \n\"What should such fellows as I do?\" Nay, \nMy part were worse if I chose to play; \nFor the worst is this after all; if they knew me, \n      Not a soul upon earth would pity me. \n\n\nAnd I play not for pity of these; but you, \n      If you saw with your soul what man am I, \nYou would praise me at least that my soul all through \n      Clove to you, loathing the lives that lie; \nThe souls and lips that are bought and sold, \nThe smiles of silver and kisses of gold, \nThe lapdog loves that whine as they chew, \n      The little lovers that curse and cry. \n\n\nThere are fairer women, I hear; that may be; \n      But I, that I love you and find you fair, \nWho are more than fair in my eyes if they be, \n      Do the high gods know or the great gods care? \nThough the swords in my heart for one were seven, \nShould the iron hollow of doubtful heaven, \nThat knows not itself whether night-time or day be, \n      Reverberate words and a foolish prayer? \n\n\nI will go back to the great sweet mother, \n      Mother and lover of men, the sea. \nI will go down to her, I and none other, \n      Close with her, kiss her and mix her with me; \nCling to her, strive with her, hold her fast: \nO fair white mother, in days long past \nBorn without sister, born without brother, \n      Set free my soul as thy soul is free. \n\n\nO fair green-girdled mother of mine, \n      Sea, that art clothed with the sun and the rain, \nThy sweet hard kisses are strong like wine, \n      Thy large embraces are keen like pain. \nSave me and hide me with all thy waves, \nFind me one grave of thy thousand graves, \nThose pure cold populous graves of thine \n      Wrought without hand in a world without stain. \n\n\nI shall sleep, and move with the moving ships, \n      Change as the winds change, veer in the tide; \nMy lips will feast on the foam of thy lips, \n      I shall rise with thy rising, with thee subside; \nSleep, and not know if she be, if she were, \nFilled full with life to the eyes and hair, \nAs a rose is fulfilled to the roseleaf tips \n      With splendid summer and perfume and pride. \n\n\nThis woven raiment of nights and days, \n      Were it once cast off and unwound from me, \nNaked and glad would I walk in thy ways, \n      Alive and aware of thy ways and thee; \nClear of the whole world, hidden at home, \nClothed with the green and crowned with the foam, \nA pulse of the life of thy straits and bays, \n      A vein in the heart of the streams of the sea. \n\n\nFair mother, fed with the lives of men, \n      Thou art subtle and cruel of heart, men say. \nThou hast taken, and shalt not render again; \n      Thou art full of thy dead, and cold as they. \nBut death is the worst that comes of thee; \nThou art fed with our dead, O mother, O sea, \nBut when hast thou fed on our hearts? or when, \n      Having given us love, hast thou taken away? \n\n\nO tender-hearted, O perfect lover, \n      Thy lips are bitter, and sweet thine heart. \nThe hopes that hurt and the dreams that hover, \n      Shall they not vanish away and apart? \nBut thou, thou art sure, thou art older than earth; \nThou art strong for death and fruitful of birth; \nThy depths conceal and thy gulfs discover; \n      From the first thou wert; in the end thou art. \n\n\nAnd grief shall endure not for ever, I know. \n      As things that are not shall these things be; \nWe shall live through seasons of sun and of snow, \n      And none be grievous as this to me. \nWe shall hear, as one in a trance that hears, \nThe sound of time, the rhyme of the years; \nWrecked hope and passionate pain will grow \n      As tender things of a spring-tide sea. \n\n\nSea-fruit that swings in the waves that hiss, \n      Drowned gold and purple and royal rings. \nAnd all time past, was it all for this? \n      Times unforgotten, and treasures of things? \nSwift years of liking and sweet long laughter, \nThat wist not well of the years thereafter \nTill love woke, smitten at heart by a kiss, \n      With lips that trembled and trailing wings? \n\n\nThere lived a singer in France of old \n      By the tideless dolorous midland sea. \nIn a land of sand and ruin and gold \n      There shone one woman, and none but she. \nAnd finding life for her love's sake fail, \nBeing fain to see her, he bade set sail, \nTouched land, and saw her as life grew cold, \n      And praised God, seeing; and so died he. \n\n\nDied, praising God for his gift and grace: \n      For she bowed down to him weeping, and said \n\"Live;\" and her tears were shed on his face \n      Or ever the life in his face was shed. \nThe sharp tears fell through her hair, and stung \nOnce, and her close lips touched him and clung \nOnce, and grew one with his lips for a space; \n      And so drew back, and the man was dead. \n\n\nO brother, the gods were good to you. \n      Sleep, and be glad while the world endures. \nBe well content as the years wear through; \n      Give thanks for life, and the loves and lures; \nGive thanks for life, O brother, and death, \nFor the sweet last sound of her feet, her breath, \nFor gifts she gave you, gracious and few, \n      Tears and kisses, that lady of yours. \n\n\nRest, and be glad of the gods; but I, \n      How shall I praise them, or how take rest? \nThere is not room under all the sky \n      For me that know not of worst or best, \nDream or desire of the days before, \nSweet things or bitterness, any more. \nLove will not come to me now though I die, \n      As love came close to you, breast to breast. \n\n\nI shall never be friends again with roses; \n      I shall loathe sweet tunes, where a note grown strong \nRelents and recoils, and climbs and closes, \n      As a wave of the sea turned back by song. \nThere are sounds where the soul's delight takes fire, \nFace to face with its own desire; \nA delight that rebels, a desire that reposes; \n      I shall hate sweet music my whole life long. \n\n\nThe pulse of war and passion of wonder, \n      The heavens that murmur, the sounds that shine, \nThe stars that sing and the loves that thunder, \n      The music burning at heart like wine, \nAn armed archangel whose hands raise up \nAll senses mixed in the spirit's cup \nTill flesh and spirit are molten in sunder \u2014 \n      These things are over, and no more mine. \n\n\nThese were a part of the playing I heard \n      Once, ere my love and my heart were at strife; \nLove that sings and hath wings as a bird, \n      Balm of the wound and heft of the knife. \nFairer than earth is the sea, and sleep \nThan overwatching of eyes that weep, \nNow time has done with his one sweet word, \n      The wine and leaven of lovely life. \n\n\nI shall go my ways, tread out my measure, \n      Fill the days of my daily breath \nWith fugitive things not good to treasure, \n      Do as the world doth, say as it saith; \nBut if we had loved each other \u2014 O sweet, \nHad you felt, lying under the palms of your feet, \nThe heart of my heart, beating harder with pleasure \n      To feel you tread it to dust and death \u2014 \n\n\nAh, had I not taken my life up and given \n      All that life gives and the years let go, \nThe wine and honey, the balm and leaven, \n      The dreams reared high and the hopes brought low? \nCome life, come death, not a word be said; \nShould I lose you living, and vex you dead? \nI never shall tell you on earth; and in heaven, \n      If I cry to you then, will you hear or know? </pre>\n "}, {"title": "basin of hills...
