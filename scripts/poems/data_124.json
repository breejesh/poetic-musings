The inheritance of repetition is a soundless gavel buried in a shallow grave.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">6. The shallow grave is the redness of the bouquet a florist selects.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">7. The bouquet is a leaning into the quiet of a funeral.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">8. The quiet of a funeral is the Americas.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">9. The Americas is a platform, built by the settlers, sheriffs, and miners, for the lynching of the other.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">10. The lynching is in a vigilance committee of NAFTA, Operation Wetback, Maquiladoras, ICE, silences, the</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 agricultural prison industrial complex, congressmen, and US presidents.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">11. The silences is a gerrymandering of census data.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">12. The census data is learning about the word incarceration through the storytelling project playing on public radio.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">13. The incarceration is an ombligo of shirts in a forest of screams.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">14. The ombligo is feeding again and never hungry.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">15. The feeding is a church of excommunications inside a cage of teeth.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">16. The cage of teeth is elected into office.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">17. The elected are voting to eliminate whatever and everything.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">18. The voting are no longer asking permission.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">19. The permission is trafficking.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">20. The trafficking is now asked to self-report.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">21. The self-report is now asked to fill out a binary form in ink, online.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">22. The binary is seeking a fourth option during the election.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">23. The election is a wall.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">24. The wall is a type of silence.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">25. The silence is a type of America.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">26. The type of America is in the arrest.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">27. The arrest is defined as the cessation or stoppage of motion.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">28. The cessation or stoppage of motion is the fabric veiling the artifice.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">29. The fabric veiling the artifice is a factory of harps.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">30. The factory of harps is a maker of a stringless harp.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">31. The stringless harp is the mute progeny.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">32.
