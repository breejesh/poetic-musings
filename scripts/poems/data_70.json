Instead, she went home for soup</p>\n<p>which is where my brother found her the next morning<br />\nseated at the kitchen counter with her head resting</p>\n<p>in her arms, as if she\u2019d only fallen asleep, after her boss<br />\nreported that she hadn\u2019t come to work. She rose</p>\n<p>each day at 5 A.M to bake muffins and fresh bread<br />\nto make the potato salad and rotisserie chickens</p>\n<p>that stock the coolers and shelves for the convenience<br />\nof others. Too young for Medicare, at 58, she earned</p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">an hourly wage that held her just above the poverty line,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">just enough to disqualify her for Medicaid. I see now</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">how she fell between the cracks. Sure, she tempted fate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">cooked with too many eggs, too much salt, sugar, butter,</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and cream. And didn\u2019t we gobble up every rich thing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">she put before us? Did she calculate the cost of the new</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">health care coverage and think, <em>Four hundred dollars</em></span><br /><em><span class=\"long-line\">a month. That\u2019s a car payment, that\u2019s forty hours of labor,</span></em></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><em>a full week of wages.</em> How I wish she\u2019d been forced</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to buy it. Did she turn right for home instead of left</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">for the clinic because she knew a trip to the doctor</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">would mean a quadruple by-pass, loss of a job,</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">bankruptcy, and the forced foreclosure of a house</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">almost paid for. ($700 left on the mortgage at the time</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">of her death.) So she decided to take the pain</span><br />\nand risk it, believing she was too tough to die.</p>\n<p>Well, she wasn\u2019t. To be human is to walk around<br /><span class=\"long-line\">with pre-existing conditions\u2014always some muscle</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">or valve poised to fail, some cell ready to grow wild. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Never before have I wanted to speak to my president</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and say, please, hurry up with this. She was my sister,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">do you understand? As children, we shared a bathtub,</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">in those years of once-a-week Saturday night washings. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I can still feel her soapy back against mine. As teenagers,</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">we shared a bedroom, whispering late into the dark</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">between our twin beds, until one of us would grow tired</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and say,<em> little red school house on the hill,</em> our private code</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for \u201cshut up now, so that I can get some sleep.\u201d </span></p>\n"}, {"title": "As dogs", "view_node": "/poem/dogs-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/rachel-b-glaser\" hreflang=\"en\">Rachel B.
