The Blue Death, face hidden in a bandanna,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">dug graves with the gravediggers, who fell into holes they shoveled for the dead. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The doctors died too, seeing the signs in the mirror, the hand with the razor shaking. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><em>II. The Second Horse</em> </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Doctor Betances stepped off the boat, back from Paris, the humidity of the plague </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">glistening in his beard. He saw the stepmother who fed him sink into a mound </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of dirt, her body empty as the husk of a locust in drought.He toweled off his hands. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the quarantine tents there was laudanum by the bitter spoonful, the lemonade </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and broth; in the dim of the kerosene lamps there was the compress cool against </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the forehead, the elixir of the bark from the cinchona tree. For peasants and slaves</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">moaning to their gods, the doctor prescribed chilled champagne to soothe the belly. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the commander of the Spanish garrison, there was silence bitter as the spoon. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><em>III. The Third Horse</em> </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At every hacienda, at every plantation, as the bodies of slaves rolled one by one</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into ditches all hipbones and ribs, drained of water and salt, stripped of names, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Doctor Betances commanded the torch for the barracks where the bodies would </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">tangle together, stacked up as if they never left the ship that sailed from Africa,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">kept awake by the ravenous worms of the plague feasting upon them. Watching </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the blue flames blacken the wood, the doctor and the slaves saw another plague</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">burning\u00a0away, the plague of manacles scraping the skin from hands that cut</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the cane, the plague of the collar with four spikes for the runaways brought back. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><em>IV. The Fourth Horse</em> </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The pestilence of the masters, stirred by spoons into the coffee of the world,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">spread first at the marketplace, at auction, the coins passing from hand to hand.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So Doctor Betances began, at church, with twenty-five pesos in pieces of eight,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pirate coins dropped into the hands of slaves to drop into the hands of masters,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">buying their\u00a0own infants at the baptismal font. The secret society of abolitionists </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">shoved rowboats full of runaways off the docks in the bluest hour of the blue night, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">off to islands without masters. Even the doctor would strangle in the executioner\u2019s </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">garrote, spittle in his beard, if the soldiers on watch woke up from the opiate of empire. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\"><em>V.
