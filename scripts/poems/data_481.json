I want to make a dark mirror out of writing: one child facing the other, like Dora and little Hans. I want to write, for example, about the violence done to my father's body as a child. In this re-telling, India is blue, green, black and yellow like the actual, reflective surface of a mercury globe. I pour the mercury into a shallow box to see it: my father's right leg, linear and hard as the bone it contains, and silver. There are scooped out places where the flesh is missing, shiny, as they would be regardless of race. A scar is memory. Memory is wrong. The wrong face appears in the wrong memory. A face, for example, condenses on the surface of the mirror in the bathroom when I stop writing to wash my face. Hands on the basin, I look up, and see it: the distinct image of an owlgirl. Her eyes protrude, her tongue is sticking out, and she has horns, wings and feet. Talons. I look into her eyes and see his. Writing makes a mirror between the two children who perceive each other. In a physical world, the mirror is a slice of dark space. How do you break a space? No. Tell me a story set in a different time, in a different place. Because I'm scared. I'm scared of the child I'm making.</p><p>48. They dragged her from a dark room and put her in a sheet. They broke her legs then re-set them. Both children, the wolfgirls, were given a fine yellow powder to clean their kidneys but their bodies, having adapted to animal ways of excreting meat, could not cope with this technology. Red worms came out of their bodies and the younger girl died. Kamala mourned the death of her sister with, as Joseph wrote, \"an affection.\" There, in a dark room deep in the Home. Many rooms are dark in India to kill the sun. In Midnapure, I stood in that room, and blinked. When my vision adjusted, I saw a picture of Jesus above a bed, positioned yet dusty on a faded turquoise wall. Many walls in India are turquoise, which is a color the human soul soaks up in an architecture not even knowing it was thirsty. I was thirsty and a girl of about eight, Joseph's great-granddaughter, brought me tea. I sat on the edge of the bed and tried to focus upon the memory available to me in the room, but there was no experience. When I opened my eyes, I observed Jesus once again, the blood pouring from his open chest, the heart, and onto, it seemed, the floor, in drips.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"}, {"title": "Besides the Autumn poets sing (131)", "view_node": "/poem/besides-autumn-poets-sing-131", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/emily-dickinson\" hreflang=\"und\">Emily Dickinson</a>", "field_date_published": "1890", "body": " <pre>\nBesides the Autumn poets sing,\t\nA few prosaic days\t\nA little this side of the snow\t\nAnd that side of the Haze -\t\n  \nA few incisive mornings -\t        \nA few Ascetic eves -\t\nGone - Mr Bryant's \"Golden Rod\" -\t\nAnd Mr Thomson's \"sheaves.\"\t\n  \nStill, is the bustle in the brook -\t\nSealed are the spicy valves -\t        \nMesmeric fingers softly touch\t\nThe eyes of many Elves -\t\n  \nPerhaps a squirrel may remain -\t\nMy sentiments to share -\nGrant me, Oh Lord, a sunny mind -        \nThy windy will to bear!</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Radio Animals", "view_node": "/poem/radio-animals", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/matthea-harvey\" hreflang=\"und\">Matthea Harvey</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <table width=\"250\"><tbody><tr><td><p align=\"justify\">The radio animals travel in lavender clouds.

Like in <i>Gladiator</i>, when they showed the cypresses\nflanking the end-road\u2014<i>O set \nYour sandal, your tandem bike, into the land of shadows</i>\u2014of course\nI cried. Show me a cypress and I'll just go off, but\nI don't want <i>that</i> to be <i>it</i>. Or\nsome kind of poem you can never find your way out of! And sometimes\n\nI think I nod at the true death: when from a moving train\nI see a house in the morning sun\nand it casts a shadow on the ground, an inquiry\nand I think \"Crisp inquiry\"\n&amp; go on to work, perfumed of it\u2014that's the kind of death\nI'm talking about.\n\nAn angle of light. Believe in it. I believe in the light and disorder of the word\nrepeated until quote Meaning unquote leeches out of it. And that's\nwhat I wanted to do with dame Death, for you:\nrepeat it until you're all, What? D-E-A-T-H? 'Cause Amy\nthat's all it is, a word, material in the way the lake through the trees\nis material, that is: insofar, not at all.\nBecause we haven't yet swam in it. See what I mean?\nI see death, I smell death, it moves the hair on my face but\n\nI don't know where it blows from. And in its sources is my power.\nI'm incredibly powerful in my ignorance. I'm incredible, like some kind of fuzzy star.\nThe nonsense of me is the nonsense of death, and\nOh look! Light through the trees on the lake:\n\nthe lake has the kind of calmness\nmy pupils' surface believes...and this is just the thing\nthat the boxed land of shades at the end of the remote\ndoesn't program for: the lake is so kind to me, Amy,\nand I'll be so kind to you, Amy, and so we'll never die:\nthere'll be plenty of us around to \nkeep casting our inquiry \nagainst the crisp light. Light is all like,\nwhat's up, I'm here I'm an angel! &amp; we're\nall: no you're not, that doesn't exist. We all laugh and laugh...\n\nOr cry and cry. The point is, it's words, and so's\ndeath. Even in that silence\nthere's bird calls or meteors or something hurtling\nthrough space: there's matter and light. I've seen it\nthrough the theater of the trees and it was beautiful\n\nIt cut my eyes and I didn't even care\n\nI already had the seeing taken care of. Even in the months I didn't have\na single poem in me, I had this death and this love, and how's\nthat not enough? I even have a quote:\n<i>Love is the angel\n\nWhich leads us into the shadow</i>, di Prima.</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 481, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
