have seen </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The noblest patch of quivering green </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lashed till it never quivered again. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">God had a fit of temper then, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And spat shrill wind and lightning out </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At twinges of some godly gout. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But as for me, I keep indoors </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whenever he starts his awful roars. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What can one hope of a crazy God </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But lashings from an aimless rod? </span></p>\n"}, {"title": "The Murderess", "view_node": "/poem/murderess", "field_author": "<a

peopled by beings whom white-men detest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sons of the Tartars, that came from the west.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">These Indians, \u2018tis certain, were here long before ye all,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And dwelt in their wigwams from time immemorial;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In a mere state of nature, untutored, untaught,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They did as they pleased, and they spoke as they thought\u2014</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No priests they had then for the

concealed\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their druggist was Nature\u2014her shop was the field.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In the midst of their forests how happy and blest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the skin of a bear or buffalo drest!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No care to perplex, and no luxury seen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the feast, and the song, and the dance on the green.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Some bowed to the moon, and some worshipped the sun,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the king and the captain were centered in one;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In a cabin they met, in their councils of state,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where age and experience alone might debate.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With quibbles they never essayed to beguile,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Nature had taught them the orator's style;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No pomp they affected, not quaintly refined</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The nervous idea that glanced on the mind.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">When hunting or battle invited to arms,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The women they left to take care of their farms\u2014</span><br /><span

came among them his dues to demand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They still had some prospects of comfort at hand\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The dead man they sent to the regions of bliss,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With his bottle and dog, and his fair maids to kiss.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<hr /><p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus

traverse the seas,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Columbus came over, that bold Genoese.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">From records authentic, the date we can shew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One thousand four hundred and ninety and two</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Years, borne by the seasons, had vanished away,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since the babe in the manger at Bethlehem lay.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">What an \u00e6ra was this, above all that had passed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To yield such a treasure, discovered at last\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A new world, in value exceeding the old,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such mountains of silver, such torrents of gold!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Yet the schemes of Columbus, however well planned</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Were scarcely sufficient to find the main land;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the islands alone with the natives he spoke,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Except when he entered the great Oronoque:</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In this he resembled old Moses, the Jew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who, roving about with his wrong-headed crew,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When at length the reward was no longer denied,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From the top of Mount Pisgah he saw it, and died.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">These islands and worlds in the watery expanse,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like most mighty things, were the offspring of chance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since steering for Asia, Columbus they say,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was astonished to find such a world in his way!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No wonder, indeed, he was smit with surprize\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This empire of Nature was new to their eyes\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cut short in their course by so splendid a scene,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such a region of wonders intruding between!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Yet great as he was, and deserving no doubt,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We have only to thank him for finding the rout;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">These climes to the northward, more stormy and cold,</span><br

class=\"long-line\">He gave them his utmost\u2014yet died in their debt,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His wealth was a crime that they could not forgive,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And when they possessed it, forbade him to live.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Foredoomed to misfortunes (that come not alone)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He was the twelfth Inca that sat on the throne,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who fleecing his brother\u00a0of half his domains,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At the palace of Cusco confined him in chains.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<hr /><p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But what am I talking\u2014or where do I roam?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2019Tis time that our story was brought nearer home\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From Florida\u2019s cape did Cabot explore</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the fast frozen region of cold Labradore.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In the year fourteen hundred and ninety and eight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He came, as the annals of England relate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But finding no gold in the lengthy domain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And coasting the country, he left it again.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Next Davis\u2014then Hudson adventured, they say,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One found out a streight, and the other a bay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose desolate region, or turbulent wave</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One present bestowed him\u2014and that was a grave.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<hr /><p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In the reign of a virgin (as authors discover)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Drake, Hawkins, and Raleigh in squadrons came over</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While Barlow and Grenville succeeded to these,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who all brought their colonies over the seas.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">These, left in a wilderness teeming with woes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The natives, suspicious, concluded them foes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And murdered them all without notice or warning,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ralph Lane, with his vagabonds, scarcely returning.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In the reign of king James (and the first of the name,)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">George Summers, with Hacluit, to Chesapeake came,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where far in the forests, not doomed to renown,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the river Powhatan\u00a0they built the first town.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Twelve years after this, some scores of dissenters</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the northernmost district came seeking adventures;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Outdone by the bishops, those great faggot fighters;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They left them to rule with their cassocks and mitres.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus banished forever, and leaving the sod,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The first land they saw was the pitch of Cape Cod,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where famished with hunger and quaking with cold</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They planned their New-Plymouth\u2014so called from the old.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They were, without doubt, a delightful collection;\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some came to be rid of a Stuart\u2019s direction,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some sailed with a view to dominion and riches,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some to pray without book, and a few to hang witches.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Some, came on the Indians to shed a new light,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Convinced long before that their own must be right,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And that all who had died in the centuries past</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the devil\u2019s lee shore were eternally cast.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">These exiles were formed in a whimsical mould,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And were awed by their priests, like the Hebrews of old;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Disclaimed all pretences to jesting and laughter,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And sighed their lives through, to be happy hereafter.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">On a crown immaterial their hearts were intent,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They looked towards Zion, wherever they went,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Did all things in hopes of a future reward,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And worried mankind\u2014for the sake of the Lord.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With rigour excessive they strengthened their reign,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their laws were conceived in the ill-natured strain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With mystical meanings the saint was perplext,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the flesh and the devil were slain by a text.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The body was scourged, for the good of the soul,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All folly discouraged by peevish controul,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A knot on the head was the sign of no grace,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the Pope and his comrade were pictured in lace.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A stove in their churches, or pews lined with green,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Were horrid to think of, much more to be seen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their bodies were warmed with the linings of love,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the fire was sufficient that flashed from above.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u2019Twas a crime to assert that the moon was opaque,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To say the earth moved, was to merit the stake;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And he that could tell an eclipse was to be,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the college of Satan had took his degree.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">On Sundays their faces were dark as a cloud\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The road to the meeting was only allowed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And those they caught rambling, on business or pleasure,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Were sent to the stocks, to repent at their leisure.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This day was the mournfullest day in the week\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Except on religion, none ventured to speak\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This day was the day to examine their lives,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To clear off old scores, and to preach to their wives.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Their houses were forts, that seemed proof against light;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their parlours, all day, were the blackness of night:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as if at their thresholds a cannon did roar,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The animals hardly dared open their door</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Till the sun disappeared\u2014then, like a mole's snout</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the dusk of the evening, their noses popped out.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In the school of oppression though woefully taught,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2019Twas only to be the oppressors they sought;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All, all but themselves were be-deviled and blind,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And their narrow-souled creed was to serve all mankind.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This beautiful system of nature below</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They neither considered, nor wanted to know,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And called it a dog-house wherein they were pent,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Unworthy themselves, and their mighty descent.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They never perceived that in Nature's wide plan</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There must be that whimsical creature called Man,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Far short of the rank he affects to attain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet a link in its place, in creation's vast chain.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<hr /><p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Whatever is foreign to us and our kind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Can never be lasting, though seemingly joined\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The hive swarmed at length, and a tribe that was teazed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Set out for Rhode-Island to think as they pleased.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Some hundreds to Britain ran murmuring home\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While others went off in the forests to roam,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When they found they had missed what they looked for at first,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The downfall of sin, and the reign of the just.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Hence, dry controversial reflections were thrown,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the old dons were vexed in the way they had shown;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So those that are held in the work-house all night</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Throw dirt the next day at the doors, out of spite.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Ah pity the wretches that lived in those days,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Ye modern admirers of novels and plays)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When nothing was suffered but musty, dull rules,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And nonsense from Mather and stuff from the schools!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No story, like Rachel's, could tempt them to sigh,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Susanna and Judith employed the bright eye\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No fine spun adventures tormented the breast,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like our modern Clarissa, Tom Jones, and the rest.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Those tyrants had chosen the books for your shelves,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(And, trust me, no other than writ by themselves,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For always by this may a bigot be known,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He speaks well of nothing but what is his own.)</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">From indwelling evil these souls to release,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Quakers arrived with their kingdom of peace\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But some were transported and some bore the lash,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And four they hanged fairly, for preaching up trash.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The lands of New-England (of which we now treat)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Were famous, ere that, for producing of wheat;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the soil (or tradition says strangely amiss)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Has been pestered with pumpkins from that day to this.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<hr /><p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus, feuds and vexations distracted their reign,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(And perhaps a few vestiges still may remain)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But time has presented an offspring as bold,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Less free to believe, and more wise than the old.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Their phantoms, their wizzards, their witches are fled,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Matthew Paris's\u00a0story with horror is read\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His daughters, and all the enchantments they bore\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the demon, that pinched them, is heard of no more.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Their taste for the fine arts is strangely increased,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Latin's no longer a mark of the beast:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mathematics, at present, a farmer may know,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Without being hanged for connections below.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Proud, rough, Independent, undaunted and free,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And patient of hardships, their task is the sea,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their country too barren their wish to attain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They make up the loss by exploring the main.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Wherever bright Ph\u0153bus awakens the gales</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I see the bold Yankees expanding their sails,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Throughout the wide ocean pursuing their schemes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And chacing the whales on its uttermost streams.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No climate, for them, is too cold or too warm,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They reef the broad canvass, and fight with the storm;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In war with the foremost their standards display,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or glut the loud cannon with death, for the fray.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No valour in fable their valour exceeds,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Their spirits are fitted for desperate deeds;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No rivals have they in our annals of fame,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or if they are rivalled, \u2019tis York has the claim.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Inspired at the sound, while the name she repeats,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bold Fancy conveys me to Hudson\u2019s retreats\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ah, sweet recollection of juvenile dreams</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the groves, and the forests that skirted his streams!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">How often, with rapture, those streams were surveyed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When, sick of the city, I flew to the shade\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How often the bard, and the peasant shall mourn</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ere those groves shall revive, or those shades shall return!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Not a hill, but some fortress disfigures it round!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And ramparts are raised where the cottage was found!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The plains and the vallies with ruin are spread,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With graves in abundance, and bones of the dead.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The first that attempted to enter the streight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(In anno one thousand six hundred and eight)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was Hudson (the same that we mentioned before,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who was lost in the gulph that he went to explore.)</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For a sum that they paid him (we know not how much)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This captain transferred all his right to the Dutch;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the time has been here, (to the world be it known,)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When all a man sailed by, or saw, was his own.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The Dutch on their purchase sat quietly down,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And fixed on an island to lay out a town;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They modelled their streets from the horns of a ram,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the name that best pleased them was, New Amsterdam.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They purchased large tracts from the Indians for beads,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And sadly tormented some runaway Swedes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who (none knows for what) from their country had flown,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To live here in peace, undisturbed and alone.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">New Belgia, the Dutch called their province, be sure,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But names never yet made possession secure,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For Charley (the second that honoured the name)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sent over a squadron, asserting his claim:</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">(Had his sword and his title been equally slender,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In vain had they summoned Mynheer to surrender)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The soil they demanded, or threatened their worst,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Insisting that Cabot had looked at it first.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The want of a squadron to fall on their rear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Made the argument perfectly plain to Mynheer\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Force ended the contest\u2014the right was a sham,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the Dutch were sent packing to hot Surinam.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u2019Twas hard to be thus of their labours deprived,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the age of Republics had not yet arrived\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fate saw\u2014though no wizzard could tell them as much\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That the crown, in due time, was to fare like the Dutch.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Supplication ", "view_node": "/poem/supplication", "field_author": "<a
