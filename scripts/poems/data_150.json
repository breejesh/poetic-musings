It's not quite true but I keep describing the same things differently, as sailboats through the locks of reversed rivers or as streaks of red across the sky, visible only in one eye. The sensation of decision-making won't stay put. I forget who I am and wake up exhausted. I had a teacher once who died, it was as if she removed herself into the forest. I scatter leaves to read them like pages as if she's speaking. She was in love. I don't know if I'm worried I will or won't ever give up my fictional autonomy. I'm choosing between two trees with two hollows. One begins breaking as I step inside, as I try to sleep. The other is already inhabited by a rooster. I pluck a feather and run to the pawn shop. How much is this worth? Can I buy it back for my Sunday best, for the suit I never wear? Maybe if I go to the church I don't believe in I'll meet a man I can.

breastplate,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Well I remember the day! once saved my life in a skirmish;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fired point-blank at my heart by a Spanish arcabucero.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Had it not been of sheer steel, the forgotten bones of Miles Standish</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Would at this moment be mould, in their grave in the Flemish morasses.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thereupon answered John Alden, but looked not up from his writing:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He in his mercy preserved you, to be our shield and our weapon!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still the Captain continued, unheeding the words of the stripling:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"See, how bright they are burnished, as if in an arsenal hanging;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That is because I have done it myself, and not left it to others.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Serve yourself, would you be well served, is an excellent adage;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I take care of my arms, as you of your pens and your inkhorn.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, too, there are my soldiers, my great, invincible army,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twelve men, all equipped, having each his rest and his matchlock,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Eighteen shillings a month, together with diet and pillage,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, like Caesar, I know the name of each of my soldiers!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This he said with a smile, that danced in his eyes, as the sunbeams</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dance on the waves of the sea, and vanish again in a moment.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Alden laughed as he wrote, and still the Captain continued:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Look! you can see from this window my brazen howitzer planted</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">High on the roof of the church, a preacher who speaks to the purpose,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Steady, straight-forward, and strong, with irresistible logic,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Orthodox, flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now we are ready, I think, for any assault of the Indians;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Let them come, if they like, and the sooner they try it the better,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Let them come if they like, be it sagamore, sachem, or pow-wow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Aspinet, Samoset, Corbitant, Squanto, or Tokamahamon!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Long at the window he stood, and wistfully gazed on the landscape,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Washed with a cold gray mist, the vapory breath of the east-wind,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Forest and meadow and hill, and the steel-blue rim of the ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lying silent and sad, in the afternoon shadows and sunshine.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gloom intermingled with light; and his voice was subdued with emotion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tenderness, pity, regret, as after a pause he proceeded:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Yonder there, on the hill by the sea, lies buried Rose Standish;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beautiful rose of love, that bloomed for me by the wayside!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She was the first to die of all who came in the Mayflower!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Better to hide from the Indian scouts the graves of our people,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lest they should count them and see how many already have perished!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sadly his face he averted, and strode up and down, and was thoughtful.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Fixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books, and among them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Prominent three, distinguished alike for bulk and for binding;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bariffe's Artillery Guide, and the Commentaries of Caesar,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Out of the Latin translated by Arthur Goldinge of London,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, as if guarded by these, between them was standing the Bible.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Musing a moment before them, Miles Standish paused, as if doubtful</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which of the three he should choose for his consolation and comfort,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whether the wars of the Hebrews, the famous campaigns of the Romans,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or the Artillery practice, designed for belligerent Christians.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Finally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous Roman,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seated himself at the window, and opened the book, and in silence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Turned o'er the well-worn leaves, where thumb-marks thick on the margin,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like the trample of feet, proclaimed the battle was hottest.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Busily writing epistles important, to go by the Mayflower,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ready to sail on the morrow, or next day at latest, God willing!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Letters written by Alden, and full of the name of Priscilla,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Full of the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla!</span></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</em> <em>\u00a0 </em><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </em><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

Friendship</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the Captain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Reading the marvellous words and achievements of Julius Caesar.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After a while he exclaimed, as he smote with his hand, palm downwards,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Heavily on the page: \"A wonderful man was this Caesar!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You are a writer, and I am a fighter, but here is a fellow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who could both write and fight, and in both was equally skilful!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Straightway answered and spake John Alden, the comely, the youthful:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Yes, he was equally skilled, as you say, with his pen and his weapons.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Somewhere have I read, but where I forget, he could dictate</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seven letters at once, at the same time writing his memoirs.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Truly,\" continued the Captain, not heeding or hearing the other,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Truly a wonderful man was Caius Julius Caesar!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Better be first, he said, in a little Iberian village,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Than be second in Rome, and I think he was right when he said it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twice was he married before he was twenty, and many times after;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Battles five hundred he fought, and a thousand cities he conquered;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He, too, fought in Flanders, as he himself has recorded;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Finally he was stabbed by his friend, the orator Brutus!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now, do you know what he did on a certain occasion in Flanders,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the rear-guard of his army retreated, the front giving way too,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the immortal Twelfth Legion was crowded so closely together</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There was no room for their swords? Why, he seized a shield from a soldier,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Put himself straight at the head of his troops, and commanded the captains,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Calling on each by his name, to order forward the ensigns;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then to widen the ranks, and give more room for their weapons;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So he won the day, the battle of something-or-other.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That's what I always say; if you wish a thing to be well done,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">All was silent again; the Captain continued his reading.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Writing epistles important to go next day by the Mayflower,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled with the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Every sentence began or closed with the name of Priscilla,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till the treacherous pen, to which he confided the secret,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of Priscilla!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Finally closing his book, with a bang of the ponderous cover,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus to the young man spake Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"When you have finished your work, I have something important to tell you.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Be not however in haste; I can wait; I shall not be impatient!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Straightway Alden replied, as he folded the last of his letters,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pushing his papers aside, and giving respectful attention:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Speak; for whenever you speak, I am always ready to listen,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Always ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thereupon answered the Captain, embarrassed, and culling his phrases:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"'T is not good for a man to be alone, say the Scriptures.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This I have said before, and again and again I repeat it;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Every hour in the day, I think it, and feel it, and say it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Oft in my lonely hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She is alone in the world; her father and mother and brother</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Died in the winter together; I saw her going and coming,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now to the grave of the dead, and now to the bed of the dying,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Patient, courageous, and strong, and said to myself, that if ever</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Two have I seen and known; and the angel whose name is Priscilla</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to reveal it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Being a coward in this, though valiant enough for the most part.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Go to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Say that a blunt old Captain, a man not of words but of actions,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Not in these words, you know, but this in short is my meaning;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am a maker of war, and not a maker of phrases.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You, who are bred as a scholar, can say it in elegant language,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden.\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">When he had spoken, John Alden, the fair-haired, taciturn stripling,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All aghast at his words, surprised, embarrassed, bewildered,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Trying to smile, and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus made answer and spake, or rather stammered than answered:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Such a message as that, I am sure I should mangle and mar it;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If you would have it well done,--I am only repeating your maxim,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gravely shaking his head, made answer the Captain of Plymouth:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Truly the maxim is good, and I do not mean to gainsay it;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But we must use it discreetly, and not waste powder for nothing.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now, as I said before, I was never a maker of phrases.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But march up to a woman with such a proposal, I dare not.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I'm not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But of a thundering \"No!\" point-blank from the mouth of a woman,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That I confess I'm afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So you must grant my request, for you are an elegant scholar,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Having the graces of speech, and skill in the turning of phrases.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Taking the hand of his friend, who still was reluctant and doubtful,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Holding it long in his own, and pressing it kindly, he added:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Though I have spoken thus lightly, yet deep is the feeling that prompts me;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then made answer John Alden: \"The name of friendship is sacred;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny you!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So the strong will prevailed, subduing and moulding the gentler,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Friendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand.</span></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </em><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </em><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </em><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

Errand</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Out of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the tranquil woods, where blue-birds and robins were building</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Towns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of verdure,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Peaceful, aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Love contending with friendship, and self with each generous impulse.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As in a foundering ship, with every roll of the vessel,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Washes the bitter sea, the merciless surge of the ocean!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Must I relinquish it all,\" he cried with a wild lamentation,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Must I relinquish it all, the joy, the hope, the illusion?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was it for this I have loved, and waited, and worshipped in silence?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was it for this I have followed the flying feet and the shadow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over the wintry sea, to the desolate shores of New England?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Truly the heart is deceitful, and out of its depths of corruption</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rise, like an exhalation, the misty phantoms of passion;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Angels of light they seem, but are only delusions of Satan.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All is clear to me now; I feel it, I see it distinctly!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For I have followed too much the heart's desires and devices,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Worshipping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This is the cross I must bear; the sin and the swift retribution.\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Crossing the brook at the ford, where it brawled over pebble and shallow,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gathering still, as he went, the May-flowers blooming around him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fragrant, filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Children lost in the woods, and covered with leaves in their slumber.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Puritan flowers,\" he said, \"and the type of Puritan maidens,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Modest and simple and sweet, the very type of Priscilla!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I will take them to her; to Priscilla the May-flower of Plymouth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Modest and simple and sweet, as a parting gift will I take them;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Breathing their silent farewells, as they fade and wither and perish,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came to an open space, and saw the disk of the ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sailless, sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east-wind;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saw the new-built house and people at work in a meadow;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Heard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Singing the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Music that Luther sang to the sacred words of the Psalmist,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Full of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Piled at her knee, her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Printed in Amsterdam, the words and the music together,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rough-hewn, angular notes, like stones in the wall of a churchyard</span><br />\n, <span class=\"long-line\">Darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She, the Puritan girl, in the solitude of the forest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Making the humble house and the modest apparel of home-spun</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beautiful with her beauty, and rich with the wealth of her being!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over him rushed, like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thoughts of what might have been, and the weight and woe of his errand;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the dreams that had faded, and all the hopes that had vanished,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Haunted by vain regrets, and pallid, sorrowful faces.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still he said to himself, and almost fiercely he said it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though it pass o'er the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is the will of the Lord; and his mercy endureth for ever!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So he entered the house: and the hum of the wheel and the singing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step on the threshold,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose as he entered, and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saying, \"I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Awkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been mingled</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent before her he stood, and gave her the flowers for an answer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Finding no words for his thought. He remembered that day in the winter,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After the first great snow, when he broke a path from the village,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house, and Priscilla</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Laughed at his snowy locks, and gave him a seat by the fireside,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow-storm.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Had he but spoken then! perhaps not in vain had he spoken;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now it was all too late; the golden moment had vanished!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So he stood there abashed, and gave her the flowers for an answer.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful Spring-time,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Talked of their friends at home, and the Mayflower that sailed on the morrow.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"I have been thinking all day,\" said gently the Puritan maiden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedge-rows of England,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the linnet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Going about as of old, and stopping to gossip together,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, at the end of the street, the village church, with the ivy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Climbing the old gray tower, and the quiet graves in the churchyard.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Kind are the people I live with, and dear to me my religion;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still my heart is so sad, that I wish myself back in Old England.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it: I almost</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched.\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thereupon answered the youth:\u2014\"Indeed I do not condemn you;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Stouter hearts than a woman's have quailed in this terrible winter.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Made by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus he delivered his message, the dexterous writer of letters,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Did not embellish the theme, nor array it in beautiful phrases,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But came straight to the point, and blurted it out like a schoolboy;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Looked into Alden's face, her eyes dilated with wonder,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered her speechless;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Why does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Making it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Had no time for such things;--such things! the words grating harshly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fell on the ear of Priscilla;

in the twilight Alden beheld him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Put on his corselet of steel, and all the rest of his armor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Buckle about his waist his trusty blade of Damascus,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Take from the corner his musket, and so stride out of the chamber.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Often his lips had essayed to speak, imploring for pardon;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the old friendship came back, with its tender and grateful emotions;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pride, and the sense of his wrong, and the burning fire of the insult.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So he beheld his friend departing in anger, but spake not,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saw him go forth to danger, perhaps to death, and he spake not!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then he arose from his bed, and heard what the people were saying,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Joined in the talk at the door, with Stephen and Richard and Gilbert,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Joined in the morning prayer, and in the reading of Scripture,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the sea-shore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as a door-step</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into a world unknown,--the corner-stone of a nation!</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There with his boat was the Master, already a little impatient</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lest he should lose the tide, or the wind might shift to the eastward,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Square-built, hearty, and strong, with an odor of ocean about him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speaking with this one and that, and cramming letters and parcels</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into his pockets capacious, and messages mingled together</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into his narrow brain, till at last he was wholly bewildered.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nearer the boat stood Alden, with one foot placed on the gunwale,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One still firm on the rock, and talking at times with the sailors,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seated erect on the thwarts, all ready and eager for starting.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He too was eager to go, and thus put an end to his anguish,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thinking to fly from despair, that swifter than keel is or canvas,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that was passing.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fixed were her eyes upon his, as if she divined his intention,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring, and patient,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strange is the heart of man, with its quick, mysterious instincts!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strange is the life of man, and fatal or fated are moments,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whereupon turn, as on hinges, the gates of the wall adamantine!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Here I remain!\" he exclaimed, as he looked at the heavens above him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wherein, blind and lost, to death he was staggering headlong.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Yonder snow-white cloud, that floats in the ether above me,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There is another hand, that is not so spectral and ghost-like,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Holding me, drawing me back, and clasping mine for protection.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Float, O hand of cloud, and vanish away in the ether!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Roll thyself up like a fist, to threaten and daunt me;

class=\"long-line\">Silent, with folded arms, stood Hobomok, friend of the white man.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Smiling at length he exclaimed to the stalwart Captain of Plymouth:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Pecksuot bragged very loud, of his courage, his strength, and his stature,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mocked the great Captain, and called him a little man; but I see now</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart Miles Standish.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the tidings thereof were brought to the village of Plymouth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as a trophy of war the head of the brave Wattawamat</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Scowled from the roof of the fort, which at once was a church and a fortress,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All who beheld it rejoiced, and praised the Lord, and took courage.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only Priscilla averted her face from this spectre of terror,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thanking God in her heart that she had not married Miles Standish;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shrinking, fearing almost, lest, coming home from his battles,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He should lay claim to her hand, as the prize and reward of his valor.</span></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 </em><em>\u00a0 \u00a0

and friends, with cattle and corn for the Pilgrims.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All in the village was peace; the men were intent on their labors,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Busy with hewing and building, with garden-plot and with merestead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Busy with breaking the glebe, and mowing the grass in the meadows,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Searching the sea for its fish, and hunting the deer in the forest.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All in the village was peace; but at times the rumor of warfare</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled the air with alarm, and the apprehension of danger.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bravely the stalwart Miles Standish was scouring the land with his forces,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Anger was still in his heart, but at times the remorse and contrition</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which in all noble natures succeed the passionate outbreak,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Came like a rising tide, that encounters the rush of a river,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Staying its current awhile, but making it bitter and brackish.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile Alden at home had built him a new habitation,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Solid, substantial, of timber rough-hewn from the firs of the forest.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wooden-barred was the door, and the roof was covered with rushes;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Latticed the windows were, and the window-panes were of paper,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Oiled to admit the light, while wind and rain were excluded.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There too he dug a well, and around it planted an orchard:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Close to the house was the stall, where, safe and secure from annoyance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Raghorn, the snow-white steer, that had fallen to Alden's allotment</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the division of cattle, might ruminate in the night-time</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over the pastures he cropped, made fragrant by sweet pennyroyal.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Oft when his labor was finished, with eager feet would the dreamer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Follow the pathway that ran through the woods to the house of Priscilla,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Led by illusions romantic and subtile deceptions of fancy,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pleasure disguised as duty, and love in the semblance of friendship.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ever of her he thought, when he fashioned the walls of his dwelling;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ever of her he thought, when he delved in the soil of his garden;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ever of her he thought, when he read in his Bible on Sunday</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Praise of the virtuous woman, as she is described in the Proverbs,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How all the days of her life she will do him good, and not evil,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her weaving!</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the Autumn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Alden, who opposite sat, and was watching her dexterous fingers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After a pause in their talk, thus spake to the sound of the spindle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Truly, Priscilla,\" he said, \"when I see you spinning and spinning,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Never idle a moment, but thrifty and thoughtful of others,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Suddenly you are transformed, are visibly changed in a moment;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You are no longer Priscilla, but Bertha the Beautiful Spinner.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter; the spindle</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Uttered an angry snarl, and the thread snapped short in her fingers;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While the impetuous speaker, not heeding the mischief, continued:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"You are the beautiful Bertha, the spinner, the queen of Helvetia;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She whose story I read at a stall in the streets of Southampton,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who, as she rode on her palfrey, o'er valley and meadow and mountain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She was so thrifty and good, that her name passed into a proverb.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So shall it be with your own, when the spinning-wheel shall no longer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hum in the house of the farmer, and fill its chambers with music.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then shall the mothers, reproving, relate how it was in their childhood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Praising the good old times, and the days of Priscilla the spinner!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful Puritan maiden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus making answer, meanwhile, to the flattering phrases of Alden:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Come, you must not be idle; if I am a pattern for housewives,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hold this skein on your hands, while I wind it, ready for knitting;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then who knows but hereafter, when fashions have changed and the manners,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of John Alden!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus, with a jest and a laugh, the skein on his hands she adjusted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He sitting awkwardly there, with his arms extended before him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She standing graceful, erect, and winding the thread from his fingers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes touching his hands, as she disentangled expertly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Twist or knot in the yarn, unawares--for how could she help it?\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Lo! in the midst of this scene, a breathless messenger entered,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yes; Miles Standish was dead!--an Indian had brought them the tidings,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Slain by a poisoned arrow, shot down in the front of the battle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into an ambush beguiled, cut off with the whole of his forces;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All the town would be burned, and all the people be murdered!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Such were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the hearers.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silent and statue-like stood Priscilla, her face looking backward</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still at the face of the speaker, her arms uplifted in horror;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But John Alden, upstarting, as if the barb of the arrow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Piercing the heart of his friend had struck his own, and had sundered</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Once and for ever the bonds that held him bound as a captive,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wild with excess of sensation, the awful delight of his freedom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mingled with pain and regret, unconscious of what he was doing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clasped, almost with a groan, the motionless form of Priscilla,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pressing her close to his heart, as for ever his own, and exclaiming:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Those whom the Lord hath united, let no man put them asunder!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Even as rivulets twain, from distant and separate sources,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seeing each other afar, as they leap from the rocks, and pursuing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each one its devious path, but drawing nearer and nearer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rush together at last, at their trysting-place in the forest;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So these lives that had run thus far in separate channels,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Coming in sight of each other, then swerving and flowing asunder,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Parted by barriers strong, but drawing nearer and nearer,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rushed together at last, and one was lost in the other.</span></p>\n<p><em>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

of clouds, from the tent of purple and scarlet,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Issued the sun, the great High-Priest, in his garments resplendent,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Holiness unto the Lord, in letters of light, on his forehead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Blessing the world he came, and the bars of vapor beneath him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gleamed like a grate of brass, and the sea at his feet was a laver!</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This was the wedding morn of Priscilla the Puritan maiden.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Friends were assembled together; the Elder and Magistrate also</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Graced the scene with their presence, and stood like the Law and the Gospel,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Simple and brief was the wedding, as that of Ruth and of Boaz.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Taking each other for husband and wife in the Magistrate's presence,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After the Puritan way, and the laudable custom of Holland.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fervently then, and devoutly, the excellent Elder of Plymouth</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Prayed for the hearth and the home, that were founded that day in affection,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speaking of life and of death, and imploring divine benedictions.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Lo! when the service was ended, a form appeared on the threshold,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clad in armor of steel, a sombre and sorrowful figure!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Why does the bride turn pale, and hide her face on his shoulder?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is it a phantom of air,--a bodiless, spectral illusion?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is it a ghost from the grave, that has come to forbid the betrothal?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Long had it stood there unseen, a guest uninvited, unwelcomed;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As when across the sky the driving rack of the rain-cloud</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grows for a moment thin, and betrays the sun by its brightness.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Once it had lifted its hand, and moved its lips, but was silent,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the room it strode, and the people beheld with amazement</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bodily there in his armor Miles Standish, the Captain of Plymouth!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grasping the bridegroom's hand, he said with emotion, \"Forgive me!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I have been angry and hurt,--too long have I cherished the feeling;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I have been cruel and hard, but now, thank God! it is ended.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh Standish,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Sensitive, swift to resent, but as swift in atoning for error.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Never so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John Alden.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thereupon answered the bridegroom: \"Let all be forgotten between us,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All save the dear, old friendship, and that shall grow older and dearer!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then the Captain advanced, and, bowing, saluted Priscilla,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gravely, and after the manner of old-fashioned gentry in England,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Something of camp and of court, of town and of country, commingled,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wishing her joy of her wedding, and loudly lauding her husband.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then he said with a smile: \"I should have remembered the adage,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If you would be well served, you must serve yourself; and moreover,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Great was the people's amazement, and greater yet their rejoicing,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Thus to behold once more the sun-burnt face of their Captain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whom they had mourned as dead; and they gathered and crowded about him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Eager to see him and hear him, forgetful of bride and of bridegroom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Questioning, answering, laughing, and each interrupting the other,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till the good Captain declared, being quite overpowered and bewildered,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He had rather by far break into an Indian encampment,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Touched with autumnal tints, but lonely and sad in the sunshine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lay extended before them the land of toil and privation;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There were the graves of the dead, and the barren waste of the sea-shore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There the familiar fields, the groves of pine, and the meadows;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But to their eyes transfigured, it seemed as the Garden of Eden,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Filled with the presence of God, whose voice was the sound of the ocean.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Friends coming forth from the house, and impatient of longer delaying,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each with his plan for the day, and the work that was left uncompleted.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then from a stall near at hand, amid exclamations of wonder,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Alden the thoughtful, the careful, so happy, so proud of Priscilla,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Brought out his snow-white steer, obeying the hand of its master,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Covered with crimson cloth, and a cushion placed for a saddle.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the noonday;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Somewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Placing her hand on the cushion, her foot in the hand of her husband,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gayly, with joyous laugh, Priscilla mounted her palfrey.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Nothing is wanting now,\" he said with a smile, \"but the distaff;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then you would be in truth my queen, my beautiful Bertha!\"</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Happy husband and wife, and friends conversing together.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pleasantly murmured the brook, as they crossed the ford in the forest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pleased with the image that passed, like a dream of love through its bosom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Tremulous, floating in air, o'er the depths of the azure abysses.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gleaming on purple grapes, that, from branches above them suspended,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the fir-tree,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of Eshcol.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a picture it seemed of the primitive, pastoral ages,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fresh with the youth of the world, and recalling Rebecca and Isaac,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Old and yet ever new, and simple and beautiful always,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So through the Plymouth woods passed onward the bridal procession.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Essay on Reentry", "view_node": "/poem/essay-reentry", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/reginald-dwayne-betts\"

I am a father driving</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his Black sons to school &amp; the death</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of a Black boy rides shotgun &amp; this</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">could be a funeral procession, the death</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a silent thing in the air, unmentioned\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">because mentioning death invites taboo:</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">if you touch my sons the blood washed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">away from the concrete must, at some </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">point, belong to you, &amp; not just to you, to</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the artifice of justice that is draped like a blue</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">g-d around your shoulders, the badge that</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">justifies the echo of the fired pistol; taboo:</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the thing that says freedom is a murderer\u2019s body</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">mangled &amp; disrupted by my constitutional</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">rights come to burden, because the killer\u2019s mind</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">refused the narrative of a brown child, his dignity,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his right to breathe, his actual fucking existence,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with all the crystalline brilliance I saw when</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">my boys first reached for me. This world best</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">invite more than story of the children bleeding</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on crisp falls days, Tamir\u2019s death must be more</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">than warning about recklessness &amp; abandoned</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">justice &amp; white terror\u2019s ghost\u2014&amp; this is</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">why I hate it all, the protests &amp; their counters,</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the Civil Rights attorneys that stalk the bodies</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of the murdered, this dance of ours that reduces</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">humanity to the dichotomy of the veil.
