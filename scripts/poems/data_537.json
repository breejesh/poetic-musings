There I discovered\n\nThe angels were once as plentiful\nAs species of flies.\nThe sky at dusk\nUsed to be thick with them.\nYou had to wave both arms\nJust to keep them away.\n\nNow the sun is shining\nThrough the tall windows.\nThe library is a quiet place.\nAngels and gods huddled\nIn dark unopened books.\nThe great secret lies\nOn some shelf Miss Jones\nPasses every day on her rounds.\n\nShe's very tall, so she keeps\nHer head tipped as if listening.\nThe books are whispering.\nI hear nothing, but she does.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Homecoming (audio only)", "view_node":

except that without\nits existence there was neither a hole nor not a hole\nI said to my friend Peter and after he left\nI walked to the tree again and put my arms\naround the trunk or almost did for I was\nembracing it preparatory should I say \nto its dying for it was one of the many \ndying trees along my river mainly\nsycamore and locust\u2014\n\nyou must tire I \nsaid to Peter always hearing the same \ntrees sung the same words singing, the same \nheart breaking I said and <i>con permissione</i>\nI will change trees though I am almost eighty\nnow, but what the hell, there probably are\nothers along the river, though there was a point\nwhen social security was kicking in I didn\u2019t \ngo to the palms nor did I go to Boca\nto traffic in herons nor did I go to Miami\nwhere my people walk around in scary \nblack suits and hats perched over their other hats\njust in case and just in case nor did I \ngo to California nor stay in Iowa nor\nbuy a farmhouse in the Pioneer Valley \nsouth of Brattleboro, thanks God, thanks God\u2014\n\nand Peter interrupts me remembering a \nsquirrel in Iowa that bit all the daisies,\na mad squirrel of sorts but <i>certes</i>  no madder\nthan our own hot shots with their squirrel rifles killing\nsquirrels from two miles up at wedding parties\nof all things, of all things\u2014\n\nand that's what you\nmean by a hole in the universe, isn't it, Peter\nasks and he remembers the garden we built\nand what we planted, how I went to the K-Mart \nand bought the cardboard planters and plastic trays\nand how we built a fence\u2014give way to groundhogs\nye black potatoes and brown tomatoes, and ah\nthe railroad ties there planted in gravel and it\nwas a hole he dug\u2014I came home one day and \nhe was into it up to his knees\u2014\n\nand Peter is \ntall, and he remembers the cosmos, I the \ndelphiniums, but both of us hated that squirrel,\neating a daisy on the highest limb of \nmy apple tree, the one that died, and she just\nlaughing and giving us the finger, and on my\ncell phone he remembers how we drove to \nthe kingdom of used lawn mowers, I on the way\nyelling out the window to every mower\nof hill and valley, how much will you take for\nthat lawn mower, that lawn mower, for \nthere is progress, <i>n\u2019est-ce pas</i>, isn't there \nPeter, I used to hate green grass but now I \nalmost adore it, and what about the holes in\nEurope and Asia I ask\u2014\n\nwhat of the holes in\nthis or that heart, he says\u2014\n\nI say repair it!\n\nHe says, and are you going to plant a Berber,\nclever of hand, to cut the colored marble\nand know how it looks a distance of five miles\nas in that notebook you scratch away with your black\nand red ballpoint you are so proud of, just like\nthe Berber chipping away knowing in your knuckles\nwhat it will look like when it's finished, each scratch\ncritical though it's not as if you were writing\nby the laws of Plato\u2014perish the thought\u2014it is\nwhat it is\u2014and you will look at it, you and me, \nand say \"that\u2019s right,\" not even, \"that\u2019s what I had\nin mind,\" for it is your knuckles that write, still blessed\nby suppleness, if not your hips, if not \nyour knees, God bless your knees, God bless the cartilage,\nGod bless the ligaments\u2014you with your hole in the universe,\nso weird and extreme.\n\n Peter says this, and he\nand I trail off and since he gave me a tape \nof Leonard Cohen with a voice so deep it shook\nmy red Honda, I thought therein did it lie, \nsomething about Vienna, something Brooklyn, \nher torn blue raincoat\u2014or his\u2014I can't get the gender \nright, the facts don\u2019t add up, it's <i>Jane</i>  and it rhymes \nwith Lili Marlene, that famous lamppost, the same\nnostalgia, his song or hers, Peter loves the turn\nand does his preacherly voice, we have just half\na minute or so to talk and throw sentences\nat one another, \"no-one knows what it means,\"\nthat is his favorite, \"no-one can understand it,\"\n\"we walk around in a fog,\" <i>I</i> say that, \n\"and live in a mist,\" \"we are in a Russian\nsweat house, climbing the bleachers, breathing pure steam.\"\n\"It's like the smoke,\" he says, \"in a Chinese painting,\nthere are the mountains and there is the hut you\u2019ll live in,\nyou barely can see the trees in the little gorge\nleft side of the hut, the green intense,\nthe tops of fir trees almost touching the steep\nbroken path;\" \"it's like living in a cloud,\"\nI say, \"though the sun is shining, whatever that \nmeans, when you're healthy and money in your pocket, \nand walking five miles an hour by your favorite\nbody of water it's hard to remember the cloud, \nyou are so sure of yourself.\"  \n\n\"What made you think \nof a hole the way you did?\" he asks.  \n\n\"My figures\nalways start with the literal and the spreading\nis like blood spreading,\" I say, \"and as for for the wound it \ncomes from growing up with coal, the murder \nof everything green, rivers burning, cities\nemptied, humans herded, the vile thinking\nof World War I and II, the hole in England,\nthe hole in Germany, and what we can't en-\ndure, the hole in Japan, Truman, the third \nassistant baker's helper, he should pick at\nhis harp in Hell, when I read about\nTamurlane, say, and how he piled up the heads,\nand David and the Moabites, he made them\nlie down to see who was longer or shorter and put\nhalf of them to death, it had to do with \nropes, he may have piled up skulls for all \nI know, and Samuel the prophet loved him to pieces, \nand Herman Cortez and Genghis Kahn, but also, \nI hate to say it, private Sharon, pig \nAriel, and the Lebanese jaunt, a massacre, \nas I remember\u2014let's not forget the names,\nSabra and Shatila\"\u2014\n\n\"It's justice you
