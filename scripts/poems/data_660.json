But that's \nanother story. It's a day when the smell of fish from Tib's hash \nhouse is so strong you could build a garage on it. We are sit-\nting in Izzy's where Carl has just built us a couple of solid \nhighballs. He's okay, Carl is, if you don't count his Roamin' \nHands and Rushin' Fingers. Then again, that should be the \nonly trouble we have in this life. Anyway, Jill says, \"Why \ndon't you tell about it? Nobody ever gets the poet's point of \nview.\" I don't know, maybe she's right. Jill's just a kid, but \nshe's been around; she knows what's what.\n     So, I tell Jill, we are at Izzy's just like now when he \ncomes in. And the first thing I notice is his hair, which has \nbeen Vitalis-ed into submission. But, honey, it won't work, \nand it gives him a kind of rumpled your-boudoir-or-mine look. \nI don't know why I noticed that before I noticed his face. \nMaybe it was just the highballs doing the looking. Anyway, \nthen I see his face, and I'm telling you\u2014I'm telling Jill\u2014this is \na masterpiece of a face.\n     But\u2014and this is the god's own truth\u2014I'm tired of\nbeauty. Really. I know, given all that happened, this must \nsound kind of funny, but it made me tired just to look at him. \nThat's how beautiful he was, and how much he spelled T-R-\nO-U-B-L-E. So I threw him back. I mean, I didn't say it, I say \nto Jill, with my mouth. But I said it with my eyes and my \nshoulders. I said it with my heart. I said, Honey, I'm throwing \nyou back. And looking back, that was the worst, I mean, the \nworst thing\u2014bar none\u2014that I could have done, because it\ndrew him like horseshit draws flies. I mean, he didn't walk\nover and say, \"Hello, girls; hey, you with the dark hair, your\nindifference draws me like horseshit draws flies.\"\n     But he said it with his eyes. And then he smiled. And\nthat smile was a gas station on a dark night. And as wearying\nas all the rest of it. I am many things, but dumb isn't one of\nthem. And here is where I say to Jill, \"I just can't go on.\" I\nmean, how we get from the smile into the bedroom, how it all\nhappens, and what all happens, just bores me. I am a concep-\ntual storyteller. In fact, I'm a conceptual liver. I prefer the\ncookbook to the actual meal. Feeling bores me. That's why I \nwrite poetry. In poetry you just give the instructions to the \nreader and say, \"Reader, you go on from here.\" And what I like\nabout poetry is its readers, because those are giving people. I \nmean, those are people you can trust to get the job done. They \npull their own weight. If I had to have someone at my back in \na dark alley, I'd want it to be a poetry reader. They're not like\nsome people, who maybe do it right if you tell them, \"Put this\nfoot down, and now put that one in front of the other, button\nyour coat, wipe your nose.\"\n     So, really, I do it for the readers who work hard and, I \nfeel, deserve something better than they're used to getting. I \ndo it for the working stiff. And I write for people, like myself, \nwho are just tired of the trickle-down theory where some-\nbody spends pages and pages on some fat book where every-\nthing including the draperies, which happen to be <i>burnt orange</i>, \nare described, and, further, are some <i>metaphor</i> for something.\nAnd this whole boggy waste trickles down to the reader in the \nform of a little burp of feeling. God, I hate prose. I think the \naverage reader likes ideas.\n     \"A sentence, unlike a line, is not a station of the cross.\" I \nsaid this to the poet Mark Strand. I said, \"I could not stand to\nwrite prose; I could not stand to have to write things like 'the \ndraperies were burnt orange and the carpet was brown.'\" And \nhe said, \"You could do it if that's all you did, if that was the \nbeginning and the end of your novel.\" So please, don't ask me \nfor a little trail of bread crumbs to get from the smile to the \nbedroom, and from the bedroom to the death at the end, al-\nthough you can ask me a lot about death. That's all I like, the \nvery beginning and the very end. I haven't got the stomach for\nthe rest of it.\n     I don't think many people do. But, like me, they're either \ntoo afraid or too polite to say so. That's why the movies are \nsuch a disaster. Now <i>there's</i> a form of popular culture that \ndoesn't have a clue. Movies should be five minutes long. You \nshould go in, see a couple of shots, maybe a room with orange \ndraperies and a rug. A voice-over would say, \"I'm having a \nhard time getting Raoul from the hotel room into the eleva-\ntor.\" And, bang, that's the end. The lights come on, everybody \nwalks out full of sympathy because this is a shared experi-\nence. Everybody in that theater knows how hard it is to get \nRaoul from the hotel room into the elevator. Everyone has had \nto do boring, dogged work. Everyone has lived a life that \nseems to inflict every vivid moment the smears, finger-\nings, and pawings of plot and feeling. Everyone has lived un-\nder this oppression.

This is what it feels like to be a huge type-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">writer in a dress. Yes, I feel we have gotten inside gertrude </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">stein, and of course it is dark inside the enormous gertrude, it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is like being locked up in a refrigerator lit only by a smiling </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">rind of cheese. Being inside gertrude is like being inside a </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">monument made of a cloud which is always moving across </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the sky which is also always moving. Gertrude is a huge gal-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">leon of cloud anchored to the ground by one small tether, yes, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I see it down there, do you see that tiny snail glued to the </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">tackboard of the landscape? That is alice. So, I am inside </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">gertrude; we belong to each other, she and I, and it is so won-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">derful because I have always been a thin woman inside of </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">whom a big woman is screaming to get out, and she's out </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">now and if a river could type this is how it would sound, pure </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and complicated and enormous. Now we are lilting across the </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">countryside, and we are talking, and if the wind could type it </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">would sound like this, ongoing and repetitious, abstracting </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and stylizing everything, like our famous haircut painted by </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Picasso. Because when you are inside our haircut you under-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">stand that all the flotsam and jetsam of hairdo have been </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">cleared away (like the forests from the New World) so that the </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">skull can show through grinning and feasting on the alarm it</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">has created. I am now, alarmingly, inside gertrude's head and I</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">am thinking that I may only be a thought she has had when </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">she imagined that she and alice were dead and gone and </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">someone had to carry on the work of being gertrude stein, and </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so I am receiving, from beyond the grave, radioactive isotopes </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of her genius saying, take up my work, become gertrude stein.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Because someone must be gertrude stein, someone must save </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">us from the literalists and realists, and narratives of the </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">beginning and end, someone must be a river that can type. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And why not I? Gertrude is insisting on the fact that while I </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">am a subgenius, weighing one hundred five pounds, and living </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in a small town with an enormous furry male husband who is </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">always in his Cadillac Eldorado driving off to sell something </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to people who do not deserve the bad luck of this mer-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">chandise in their lives--that these facts would not be a prob-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">lem for gertrude stein. Gertrude and I feel that, for instance, in </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><em>Patriarchal Poetry</em> when (like an avalanche that can type) she is </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">burying the patriarchy, still there persists a sense of con-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">descending affection. So, while I'm a thin, heterosexual sub-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">genius, nevertheless gertrude has chosen me as her tool, just </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as she chose the patriarchy as a tool for ending the patriarchy. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And because I have become her tool, now, in a sense, gertrude</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is inside me. It's tough. Having gertrude inside me is like </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">having swallowed an ocean liner that can type, and, while I </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">feel like a very small coat closet with a bear in it, gertrude and </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I feel that I must tell you that gertrude does not care. She is </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">using me to get her message across, to say, I am lost, I am</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">beset by literalists and narratives of the beginning and middle </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and end, help me. And so, yes, I say, yes, I am here, gertrude, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">because we feel, gertrude and I, that there is real urgency in </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">our voice (like a sob that can type) and that things are very </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">bad for her because she is lost, beset by the literalists and </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">realists, her own enormousness crushing her and we must </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">find her and take her into ourselves, even though I am the </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">least likely of saviors and have been chosen perhaps as a last </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">resort, yes, definitely, gertrude is saying to me, you are the </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">least likely of saviors, you are my last choice and my last </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">resort.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "A Boat Is a Lever", "view_node": "/poem/boat-lever", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/ralph-burns\" hreflang=\"und\">Ralph Burns</a>", "field_date_published": "1996", "body": " <blockquote>--after Simone Weil</blockquote>\n<pre>\nAfter my student went to the doctor to\nCheck out the rash speckling his\nRight hand and found out he had\nLeukemia, that the cancer had spread\nInto his lungs, then where did he go?\nI've called his number several times.\nFlat-bottom boats light in water.\nBrown brack and mud smell,\nStumps like chewed-off candles,\nCypress knees, knock and small\nTalk floating over water, a motor\nChuffing off, a small blue cloud of excess\nGasoline spreads an ugly\nRainbow on tan water.

The leaping light\nand silence.  Through channels of urgent voluntary\n    sing-song, passing tones in the hallway\nmirror, tension through the saunter of water cooled\n    air, all is gone.  You don't have to remember.\nOnly that violation in the upper registers which\n    sounded and does sound in houses\njust a few blocks over, and in fact, in this house\n    which is hot at night and cunning,\nwaits for a future.
