Their song<br />would wake me\u2014their longing.<br />It was a language I knew,</p><p>though I couldn\u2019t make out the words.<br />But the music\u2014that was theirs.<br />Some ancient secret. A string of notes<br />piecing together who they once were.</p><p>My twin brother slept soundly.<br />I was alone with this mystery.<br />It haunts me even now, this lament<br />to their gods. If flowers were songs\u2014</p><p>if the marigold sang, it would mourn<br />like this. I imagine them still<br />sitting on a dark hill chanting<br />their dirge. Some nights I wake\u2014</p><p>I hear them. I don\u2019t remember<br />my dreams, so I dutifully make<br />my way to the window.<br />All I see are clouds and mist.</p> "}, {"title": "The Small Claim of Bones", "view_node":
