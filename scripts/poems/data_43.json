/><span class=\"long-line\">She never omitted her \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthanks\u201d;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She swallowed her spinach without a squawk;</span><br /><span

plants;<br />\nShe didn\u2019t disremember expensive toys;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And never would play with the little boys. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And when to

class=\"long-line\">And never went riding around the park;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She wouldn\u2019t put powder upon her nose;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And petticoats

/><span class=\"long-line\">In presence of elders, she held her tongue\u2013\u2013</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The way that they did when the world was young. </span><br /><span

class=\"long-line\">And shattered the windows with fair-sized rocks;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The words on the fences she\u2019d memorize;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She

"<p><span class=\"long-line\">A lover whom duty called over the wave,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With himself communed: \"Will my love be true</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If left to herself? Had I better not sue</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some friend to watch over her, good and grave?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But my friend might fail in my need,\" he said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"And I return to find love dead.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Since friendships fade like the flow'rs of June,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I will leave her in charge of the stable moon.\"</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then he said to the moon: \"O dear old moon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who for years and years from thy throne above</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hast nurtured and guarded young lovers and love,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My heart has but come to its waiting June,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the promise time of the budding vine;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Oh, guard thee well this love of mine.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And he harked him then while all was still,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the pale moon answered and said, 'I will.'</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And he sailed in his ship o'er many seas,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And he wandered wide o'er strange far strands:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in isles of the south and in Orient lands,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where pestilence lurks in the breath of the breeze.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But his star was high, so he braved the main,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And sailed him blithely home again;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And with joy he bended his footsteps soon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To learn of his love from the matron moon.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She sat as of yore, in her olden place,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Serene as death, in her silver chair.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A white rose gleamed in her whiter hair,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the tint of a blush was on her face.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At sight of the youth she sadly bowed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And hid her face 'neath a gracious cloud.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She faltered faint on the night's dim marge,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But \"How,\"\u00a0spoke the youth, \"have you kept your charge?\"</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The moon was sad at a trust ill-kept;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The blush went out in her blanching cheek,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And her voice was timid and low and weak,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As she made her plea and sighed and wept.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Oh, another prayed and another plead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I couldn't resist,\"\u00a0she answering said;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"But love still grows in the hearts of men:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Go forth, dear youth, and love again.\"</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But he turned him away from her proffered grace.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"Thou art false, O moon, as the hearts of men,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I will not, will not love again.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And he turned sheer 'round with a soul-sick face</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the sea, and cried: \"Sea, curse the moon,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who makes her vows and forgets so soon.\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the awful sea with anger stirred,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And his breast heaved hard as he lay and heard.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And ever the moon wept down in rain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And ever her sighs rose high in wind;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But the earth and sea were deaf and blind,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And she wept and sighed her griefs in vain.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And ever at night, when the storm is fierce,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The cries of a wraith through the thunders pierce;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the waves strain their awful hands on high</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To tear the false moon from the sky.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Empty", "view_node": "/poem/empty-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/naomi-shihab-nye\"
