fingers into her clean cat's mouth, \nAnd rubbed her swollen belly that will never know kittens, \nAnd watched her wriggle onto her side, pawing the air, \nAnd listened to her solemn little squeals of delight, \nI was thinking about the poet, Christopher Smart, \nWho wanted to kneel down and pray without ceasing \nIn every one of the splintered London streets,\n \nAnd was locked away in the madhouse at St. Luke's \nWith his sad religious mania, and his wild gratitude, \nAnd his grave prayers for the other lunatics, \nAnd his great love for his speckled cat, Jeoffry. \nAll day today\u2014August 13, 1983\u2014I remembered how \nChristopher Smart blessed this same day in August, 1759, \nFor its calm bravery and ordinary good conscience. \n\nThis was the day that he blessed the Postmaster General \n\"And all conveyancers of letters\" for their warm humanity, \nAnd the gardeners for their private benevolence \nAnd intricate knowledge of the language of flowers, \nAnd the milkmen for their universal human kindness. \nThis morning I understood that he loved to hear\u2014\nAs I have heard\u2014the soft clink of milk bottles \nOn the rickety stairs in the early morning, \n\nAnd how terrible it must have seemed \nWhen even this small pleasure was denied him. \nBut it wasn't until tonight when I knelt down \nAnd slipped my hand into Zooey's waggling mouth \nThat I remembered how he'd called Jeoffry \"the servant \nOf the Living God duly and daily serving Him,\" \nAnd for the first time understood what it meant. \nBecause it wasn't until I saw my own cat \n \nWhine and roll over on her fluffy back \nThat I realized how gratefully he had watched \nJeoffry fetch and carry his wooden cork \nAcross the grass in the wet garden, patiently \nJumping over a high stick, calmly sharpening \nHis claws on the woodpile, rubbing his nose \nAgainst the nose of another cat, stretching, or \nSlowly stalking his traditional enemy, the mouse, \nA rodent, \"a creature of great personal valour,\" \nAnd then dallying so much that his enemy escaped. \n\nAnd only then did I understand \nIt is Jeoffry\u2014and every creature like him\u2014 \nWho can teach us how to praise\u2014purring \nIn their own language, \nWreathing themselves in the living fire. </pre>\n "}, {"title": "I&#039;m Going to Start Living Like a Mystic", "view_node":
