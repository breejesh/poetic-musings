My mind swims around, trying to remember if molecules are bigger than atoms. <em>In models of atoms, when they show what they look like, there are lots of circles,</em> I say.\n \nThe new chair of women\u2019s studies at my alma mater is a man. He writes me without using my professional title to ask what I\u2019ve been up to since graduation. His work, the letter says, has been mentioned on NPR.  \n \n<em>Quarks?</em> I think, imagining electrons swimming in circles around neutrons.  \n \nBefore bed, I tell my son a story about when he was a small bear living with his bear family in a remote part of the forest. I describe the white snow, the black branches, the brightness of the cardinal on a top branch who greets him when he leaves his cottage. This is meant to be lulling. \n \n<em>Bears hibernate in winter</em>, he says. <em>Do you want to be hibernating?</em> I say. <em>No!</em> he is seized by a narrative impulse, his little body trembles with it. <em>Tell how I could turn into a polar bear when I was cold and into a fearsome desert bear when I got hot! Tell how surprised everyone was.</em>\n \nI tell all about it, the fearsomeness and the changing fur. How he once sat there half-polar and half-desert bear, sipping hot cocoa with marshmallows by the cozy fire.  \n \nIn the morning, I leave my son at school. I am dissatisfied with how they greet him. The teachers do not know of his powers. His fearsome magic. <em>Have a good day</em>, I say, kissing his crown. <em>Have a good Friday at home</em>, he says, following me to the door. <em>Have a good shopping trip</em>. \n \nAt home I straighten my bed, turn it down, and slip back in. I lie very still, with pillow levees on either side of my body. <em>My son is safe at school</em>... I think. <em>Most likely safe at school</em>\u2026 I try not to think about what the ER doctor said, what machine guns do to human organs. I only tremble a little bit.  \n \n<em>A molecule, an atom, a particle, a quark</em>, I think. A mourning dove calls, and it is lulling. Particle was the word that I forgot.  \n \nThis is what I\u2019ve been up to since graduation.\n</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 215, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
