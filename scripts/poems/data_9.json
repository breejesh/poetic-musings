Every thought washed of color and their chains rusted over.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Our certainty absorbed into forms of circulation. Plasma-rich consistencies. Or spittle. It was difficult to make out the occasion. Or to whom we owed the honor.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No one suffered a wound. Nor suffered without good reason. The occasion filled to capacity our uncharted, elemental mouths.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">//</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The only meaningful thought tore itself from the valley.

Fundamental as the air before rain.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The circumstances formed around our suffering decayed from the point of initiation inward. This so abandonment became common.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We trained our ears to wake and comprehend the hour. Deliver oxygen. Rest one foot in its light.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">//\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We rose our heads only to say, fuck learnedness. Behavior that could only exist in the mouth acquired by failure.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Articulate and reform the needle drawn up into the roof of its suffering.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We weren\u2019t coming back</span><span><span><span><span><span><span>\u2014</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"long-line\">not one night we said</span><span><span><span><span><span><span>\u2014</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"long-line\">to that disease-shaded landscape.

Non-glorious. Scars that festered when we did not proceed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">What underpinned the context profited in its depletion. In frequent marshes.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Trust, it\u2019s one true follower.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">//</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Undressing was performed in accordance with regularity. Its networks regulated and perverse, context required no record. Met us squarely in our eyes.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The eye that awned.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The loud immeasurable eye.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The eye hugging the feet of our failure required collaboration\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">that could only be offered between streams. Or given in the rivers that fed themselves.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">//</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We woke with dreams pulled through fine intelligent mesh.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">An intelligence that aged gracefully, like iron. Hardly undone. Such were the overwhelmed conditions upon which our senses depended. The just barely.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The thorn a fundamental characteristic of our sides.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We saw history was outlined in our ruin of stitches, appearing despite the context that was their given keloid nature.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">What is a vulnerable frontier. It was important to ask of our musculature seizing.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">//</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Language returned through the appearance of clouds. Furtive, deeply shadowed offering nothing.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We stood adjacent. Looked up and rubbed our arms.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">While not offensive, it\u2019s inappropriate to remain in the procession and offer nothing. Not shade nor rosettes. No part in restoring the fence. Neither the most obvious: rain.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We should start a committee, someone said. THE COMMITTEE TO END LANGUAGE THAT DOES NOT OFFER RAIN, of which the goals and bylaws were as heart-felt as they were without collective teeth.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">//</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We woke to vandalization relative to the committee.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Someones it seemed, were, in their quiet nighttime way, against what they interpreted as the public shaming of non-productive existence. And for the first time in memory, accountability was on the table. It was bulbous and moist. It absorbed all of the blame which was not at all called for.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It said I have introduced ideological context.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I ruined the stitches.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I don\u2019t feel seen.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019m absorbed by failure.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I drink from the river and feel nothing.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">My gaze depletes.\u00a0</span></p>\n\n<p><span
