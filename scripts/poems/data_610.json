They were happy just to see him run\n    away. The coward! All Jews were yellow.\nThey spelled Jew with a small j jew.\nAnd now they find out they are Jews themselves.\nIt happened at the time of the Spanish Inquisition.\nTo escape persecution, they pretended to convert to Christianity.\nThey came to this country and settled in the Southwest.\nAt some point oral tradition failed the family, and their\n    secret faith died.\nNo one would ever have known if not for the bones that turned up\n    on the dig.\nA disaster. How could it have happened to them?\nThey are in a state of panic--at first.\nThen they realize that it is the answer to their prayers.\nThey hasten to the synagogue or build new ones.\nThey are Jews at last!\nThey are free to marry other Jews, and divorce them, and intermarry\n    with Gentiles, God forbid.\nThey are model citizens, clever and thrifty.\nThey debate the issues.\nThey fire off earnest letters to the editor.\nThey vote.\nThey are resented for being clever and thrifty.\nThey buy houses in the suburbs and agree not to talk so loud.\nThey look like everyone else, drive the same cars as everyone else,\n    yet in their hearts they know they're different.\nIn every <i>minyan</i> there are always two or three, hated by \n    the others, who give life to one ugly stereotype or another:\nThe grasping Jew with the hooked nose or the Ivy League Bolshevik\n    who thinks he is the agent of world history.\nBut most of them are neither ostentatiously pious nor\n    excessively avaricious.\nHow I envy them! They <em>believe</em>.\nHow I envy them their annual family reunion on Passover,\n    anniversary of the Exodus, when all the uncles and aunts and\n    cousins get together.\nThey wonder about the heritage of Judaism they are passing along\n    to their children.\nHave they done as much as they could to keep the old embers\n    burning?\nOthers lead more dramatic lives.\nA few go to Israel.\nOne of them calls Israel \"the ultimate concentration camp.\"\nHe tells Jewish jokes.\nOn the plane he gets tipsy, tries to seduce the stewardess.\nPeople in the Midwest keep telling him reminds them of Woody\n    Allen.\nHe wonders what that means. I'm funny? A sort of nervous\n    intellectual type from New York? A Jew?\nAround this time somebody accuses him of not being Jewish enough.\nIt is said by resentful colleagues that his parents changed their\n    name from something that sounded more Jewish.\nEverything he publishes is scrutinized with reference to \"the\n    Jewish question.\"\nIt is no longer clear what is meant by that phrase.\nHe has already forgotten all the Yiddish he used to know, and\n    the people of that era are dying out one after another.\nThe number of witnesses keeps diminishing.\nSoon there will be no one left to remind the others and their\n    children.\nThat is why he came to this dry place where the bones have come\n    to life.\nTo live in a state of perpetual war puts a tremendous burden on the\n    population. As a visitor he felt he had to share that burden.\nWith his gift for codes and ciphers, he joined the counter-\n    terrorism unit of army intelligence.\nContrary to what the spook novels say, he found it possible to\n    avoid betraying either his country or his lover.\nThis was the life: strange bedrooms, the perfume of other men's\n    wives.\nAs a spy he has a unique mission: to get his name on the front \n    page of the nation's newspaper of record. Only by doing that \n    would he get the message through to his immediate superior.\nIf he goes to jail, he will do so proudly; if they're going to\n    hang him anyway, he'll do something worth hanging for.\nIn time he may get used to being the center of attention, but\n    this was incredible:\nTo talk his way into being the chief suspect in the most \n    flamboyant murder case in years!\nAnd he was innocent!\nHe could prove it!\nAnd what a book he would write when they free him from this prison:\nA novel, obliquely autobiographical, set in Vienna in the twilight\n    of the Hapsburg Empire, in the year that his mother was born.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Man in Clown Outfit", "view_node": "/poem/man-clown-outfit", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/gretchen-mattox\" hreflang=\"und\">Gretchen Mattox</a>", "field_date_published": "2004", "body": " <pre>\nHe's waving a plastic pointer, stiff flag enter lot here, parking\nat the edge of Lincoln--bright-yellow clown suit with bold ruffles\n   and floppy shoes\n(the kind with stuffed toes) and from even a short distance he could be\nanyone degraded selling what?, he could be, but he is a man,\n   clearly Mexican,\nunderneath the nose that honks, a black mustache, illegal alien? probably.\nLike the girls in bikini tops and grass skirts outside casinos in\n   Las Vegas,\nwho say <i>Come get your free lei</i> (colored plastic wrap \u00e1 la Hawaii), he does\nwhat he's been told to do: on automatic, flag arm ticking like a metronome.\n\nUnderneath the painted smile is another expression--harder to place.\nThe urgency of traffic, who has time to care?\nHe takes his job seriously.
