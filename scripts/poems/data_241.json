  Than the Phanix itself, seems the Park Pimlico.\n\n  O 'tis there that the spoort is, when the Queen and the Court is\n    Walking magnanimous all of a row,\n  Forgetful what state is among the

sweet philoso'phy, or crumpets and coffee,\n    O where's a Pavilion like sweet Pimlico?\n\n  O to praise this Pavilion would puzzle Quintilian,\n    Daymosthenes, Brougham, or young Cicero;\n  So
