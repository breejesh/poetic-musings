hreflang=\"und\">Billy Collins</a>", "field_date_published": "1995", "body": " <pre>\nI might as well begin by saying how much I like the title. \nIt gets me right away because I\u2019m in a workshop now \nso immediately the poem has my attention, \nlike the Ancient Mariner grabbing me by the sleeve. \n\nAnd I like the first couple of stanzas, \nthe way they establish this mode of self-pointing \nthat runs through the whole poem \nand tells us that words are food thrown down \non the ground for other words to eat. \nI can almost taste the tail of the snake \nin its own mouth, \nif you know what I mean. \n\nBut what I\u2019m not sure about is the voice, \nwhich sounds in places very casual, very blue jeans, \nbut other times seems standoffish, \nprofessorial in the worst sense of the word \nlike the poem is blowing pipe smoke in my face. \nBut maybe that\u2019s just what it wants to do. \n\nWhat I did find engaging were the middle stanzas, \nespecially the fourth one. \nI like the image of clouds flying like lozenges \nwhich gives me a very clear picture. \nAnd I really like how this drawbridge operator \njust appears out of the blue \nwith his feet up on the iron railing \nand his fishing pole jigging\u2014I like jigging\u2014 \na hook in the slow industrial canal below. \nI love slow industrial canal below. All those l\u2019s. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, \nbut the next stanza is where I start to have a problem. \nI mean how can the evening bump into the stars? \nAnd what\u2019s an obbligato of snow? \nAlso, I roam the decaffeinated streets. \nAt that point I\u2019m lost. I need help. \n\nThe other thing that throws me off, \nand maybe this is just me, \nis the way the scene keeps shifting around. \nFirst, we\u2019re in this big aerodrome \nand the speaker is inspecting a row of dirigibles, \nwhich makes me think this could be a dream. \nThen he takes us into his garden, \nthe part with the dahlias and the coiling hose, \nthough that\u2019s nice, the coiling hose, \nbut then I\u2019m not sure where we\u2019re supposed to be. \nThe rain and the mint green light, \nthat makes it feel outdoors, but what about this wallpaper? \nOr is it a kind of indoor cemetery? \nThere\u2019s something about death going on here. \n\nIn fact, I start to wonder if what we have here \nis really two poems, or three, or four, \nor possibly none. \n\nBut then there\u2019s that last stanza, my favorite. \nThis is where the poem wins me back, \nespecially the lines spoken in the voice of the mouse. \nI mean we\u2019ve all seen these images in cartoons before, \nbut I still love the details he uses \nwhen he\u2019s describing where he lives. \nThe perfect little arch of an entrance in the baseboard, \nthe bed made out of a curled-back sardine can, \nthe spool of thread for a table. \nI start thinking about how hard the mouse had to work \nnight after night collecting all these things \nwhile the people in the house were fast asleep, \nand that gives me a very strong feeling, \na very powerful sense of something. \nBut I don\u2019t know if anyone else was feeling that. \nMaybe that was just me. \nMaybe that\u2019s just the way I read it. \n</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 550, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
