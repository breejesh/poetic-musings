/><span class=\"long-line\">But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and from the heave of the water,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horse-man in his saddle,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The female soothing a child, the

/><span class=\"long-line\">I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This man was a wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He drank water only, the blood show\u2019d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail\u2019d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the

flesh is enough,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">5</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This is the female form,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear\u2019d of hell, are now consumed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious nice,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Undulating into the willing and yielding day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh\u2019d day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This the nucleus\u2014after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The female contains all qualities and tempers them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She is all things duly veil\u2019d, she is both passive and active,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">As I see my soul reflected in Nature,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">6</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his

class=\"long-line\">Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The man\u2019s body is sacred and the woman\u2019s body is sacred,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No matter who it is, it is sacred\u2014is it the meanest one in the laborers\u2019 gang?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each has his or her place in the procession.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">(All is a procession,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For you only, and not for him and her?</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">7</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A

sloven does not half know his business.</span><br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gentlemen look on this wonder,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll\u2019d.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In this head the all-baffling brain,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In it and below it the makings of heroes.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They shall be stript that you may see them.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And wonders within there yet.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Within there runs blood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The same old blood! the same red-running blood!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Do you think they are not there because they are not express\u2019d in parlors and lecture-rooms?)</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In him the start of populous states and rich republics,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?)</span></p>\n\n<p><br /><span

woman?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Have you ever loved the body of a man?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face.</span><br /><span
