then said:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cPride goeth forth on horseback grand and gay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But cometh back on foot, and begs its way;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fame is the fragrance of heroic deeds,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of flowers of chivalry and not of weeds!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">These are familiar proverbs; but I fear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They never yet have reached your knightly ear.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What fair renown, what honor, what repute</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Can come to you from starving this poor brute?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He who serves well and speaks not, merits more</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Than they who clamor loudest at the door.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Therefore the law decrees that as this steed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Served you in youth, henceforth you shall take heed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To comfort his old age, and to provide</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shelter in stall, and food and field beside.\u201d</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The Knight withdrew abashed; the people all</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Led home the steed in triumph to his stall.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The King heard and approved, and laughed in glee,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And cried aloud: \u201cRight well it pleaseth me!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Church-bells at best but ring us to the door;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But go not in to mass; my bell doth more:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It cometh into court and pleads the cause</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of creatures dumb and unknown to the laws;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And this shall make, in every Christian clime,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Bell of Atri famous for all time.\u201d</span></p>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 161, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
