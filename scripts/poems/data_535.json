though he never fight.\nOff with that girdle, like heaven's zone glistering,\nBut a far fairer world encompassing.\nUnpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,\nThat th'eyes of busy fools may be stopped there.\nUnlace yourself, for that harmonious chime\nTells me from you that now it is bed time.\nOff with that happy busk, which I envy,\nThat still can be, and still can stand so nigh.\nYour gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,\nAs when from flowery meads th'hills shadow steals.\nOff with your wiry coronet and show\nThe hairy diadem which on you doth grow:\nNow off with those shoes: and then safely tread\nIn this love's hallowed temple, this soft bed.\nIn such white robes heaven's angels used to be\nReceived by men; thou, Angel, bring'st with thee\nA heaven like Mahomet's Paradise; and though\nIll spirits walk in white, we easily know\nBy this these Angels from an evil sprite:\nThose set our hairs, but these our flesh upright.\n License my roving hands, and let them go\nBefore, behind, between, above, below.\nO my America! my new-found-land,\nMy kingdom, safeliest when with one man manned,\nMy mine of precious stones, my empery,\nHow blest am I in this discovering thee!\nTo enter in these bonds is to be free;\nThen where my hand is set, my seal shall be.\n Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee,\nAs souls unbodied, bodies unclothed must be,\nTo taste whole joys. Gems which you women use\nAre as Atlanta's balls, cast in men's views,\nThat when a fool's eye lighteth on a gem,\nHis earthly soul may covet theirs, not them:\nLike pictures, or like books' gay coverings made\nFor lay-men, are all women thus arrayed.\nThemselves are mystic books, which only we\n(Whom their imputed grace will dignify)\nMust see revealed. Then, since that I may know,\nAs liberally as to a midwife, show\nThyself: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,\nThere is no penance due to innocence:\n To teach thee, I am naked first; why than,\nWhat need'st thou have more covering than a man?</pre>\n "}, {"title": "WHERE?", "view_node": "/poem/where", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/kenneth-patchen\" hreflang=\"und\">Kenneth Patchen</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <pre>\nThere's a place the man always say\nCome in here, child\nNo cause you should weep\nWolf never catch such a rabbit\nGolden hair never turn white with grief \nCome in here, child\nNo cause you should moan \nBrother never hurt his brother \nNobody here ever wander without a home\nThere must be some such place somewhere\nBut I never heard of it</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Come Slowly\u2014Eden (211)", "view_node": "/poem/come-slowly-eden-211", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/emily-dickinson\" hreflang=\"und\">Emily Dickinson</a>", "field_date_published": "1890", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Come slowly\u2014Eden</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lips unused to Thee\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bashful\u2014sip thy Jessamines</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As the fainting Bee\u2014</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Reaching late his flower,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Round her chamber hums\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Counts his nectars\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Enters\u2014and is lost in Balms.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Embodies", "view_node": "/poem/embodies", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jorie-graham\" hreflang=\"und\">Jorie Graham</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <pre>\nDeep autumn &amp;
