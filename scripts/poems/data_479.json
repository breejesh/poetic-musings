On average, each Chamorro consumes 16 tins of SPAM\u00ae each year, which is more per capita than any country in the world. Headline: Guam Struggles to Find Its Roots From Beneath Growing Piles of SPAM\u00ae. Guam, Hawaii, and Saipan have the only McDonald's restaurants that feature SPAM\u00ae on the menu. I went to the \"World's Largest K-Mart\" in Guam and I was amazed at the SPAM\u00ae display\u2026it was like a whole \"Wall of SPAM\u00ae.\" SPAM\u00ae has a place not only in the stomachs of Guam's people, but in our hearts as well. Here SPAM\u00ae is considered a gourmet luxury and is often presented as a gift at birthdays, weddings, and funerals. Hormel even made a Hot and Spicy SPAM\u00ae especially formulated for Guam with Tabasco already added to it! A culinary legacy of American troops stationed in the Pacific during World War Two, the GIs noticed how much the people of Guam loved SPAM\u00ae, so they started to jokingly call it \"Chamorro Steak.\" Not coincidentally, SPAM\u00ae is also popular in Hawaii, the Philippines, Okinawa, and Saipan, all places with a history of a U.S. military presence. In fact, SPAM\u00ae may have been responsible for Hitler's defeat. The Allies would not have won WWII without SPAM\u00ae. Plus, it's processed so I guess we can keep it forever right? Wow, I haven't seen this much SPAM\u00ae since I lived on Guam and the car dealership there started offering 50lb bags of rice and cases of SPAM\u00ae with every purchase. The end result can be found in the newspaper's obituary pages. In 2004, Public Health reported that heart disease was the leading cause of death on Guam, representing 33.7% of deaths. You can rub the entire block of SPAM\u00ae, along with the accompanying delicious gelatinous goo, onto wood furniture. The oils from the SPAM\u00ae moisturize the wood and give the furniture a nice luster. Plus, you'll have enough left over to polish some of your neighbors' furniture. You'll be like Santa Claus meets Mr. Clean. How did I miss hearing about the \"In Honor of Guam's Liberation\" SPAM\u00ae! I thought I had collected them all! But as I got older and tried to be \"healthier\" (whatever that means, haha), SPAM\u00ae faded from my consciousness. Then I met my future wife, who is Hawaiian, and SPAM\u00ae became part of my life again. Maybe the economic downturn will help people truly appreciate SPAM\u00ae instead of loathing it. SPAM\u00ae doesn't have to be unhealthy. I eat SPAM\u00ae on a regular basis and I'm not dead yet. Just switch to SPAM\u00ae Lite. In the devastating wake of Typhoon Omar, SPAM\u00ae arrived. Hormel Foods donated 40,000 cases of the belly-filling foodstuff to the Salvation Army's disaster relief effort. That's about six million SPAM\u00aeburgers! Despite rumors, SPAM\u00ae is NOT made of such odds and ends as hooves, ears, brains, native people, or whole baby pigs. SPAM\u00ae is for realz made of pork shoulder, ham, salt, water, sugar, and sodium nitrate, if you can belief it. The name itself stands for <i>Specially Processed Army Meat</i>, <i>Salted Pork And More</i>, <i>Super Pink Artificial Meat</i>, <i>Squirrel Possum And Mouse</i>, or <i>Some People Are Missing</i>. My uncle is the reigning Guam SPAM\u00ae king. He won the last SPAM\u00ae cook-off with his Spicy SPAM\u00ae meatballs. I will never forget the two-pound SPAM\u00ae bust of George Washington he made for Liberation Day, toasted crispy on the outside with raw egg yolk in the hollow center. The kids loved it! Only a fool would start a company in Guam that provides SPAM\u00ae protection. We don't want to be protected from SPAM\u00ae bots. For Xmas, I bought a SPAM\u00ae snow-globe featuring a can of SPAM\u00ae sitting on an island; turn it over and a typhoon swirls madly, unable to unseat SPAM\u00ae from its place of honor. I have a souvenir can I bought after seeing Monty Python's SPAM\u00aeALOT on Broadway. It cost me $10 and is the most expensive SPAM\u00ae I've ever bought. I will never eat it.</p> "}, {"title": "Talk", "view_node": "/poem/talk", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/kwame-dawes\" hreflang=\"und\">Kwame Dawes</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For August Wilson\n\nNo one quarrels here, no one has learned\nthe yell of discontent\u2014instead, here in Sumter\nwe learn to grow silent, build a stone\nof resolve, learn to nod, learn to close\nin the flame of shame and anger\nin our hearts, learn to petrify it so,\nand the more we quiet our ire,\nthe heavier the stone; this alchemy\nof concrete in the vein, the sludge\nof affront, until even that will calcify\nand the heart, at last, will stop,\nunassailable, unmovable, adamant.\n\nFind me a man who will stand\non a blasted hill and shout,\nfind me a woman who will break   \ninto shouts, who will let loose\na river of lament, find the howl\nof the spirit, teach us the tongues\nof the angry so that our blood,\nmy pulse\u2014our hearts flow\nwith the warm healing of anger.\n\nYou, August, have carried in your belly\nevery song of affront your characters\nhave spoken, and maybe you waited\ntoo long to howl against the night,\nbut each evening on some wooden\nstage, these men and women,\nlearn to sing songs lost for centuries,\nlearn the healing of talk, the calming\nof quarrel, the music of contention,\nand in this cacophonic chorus,\nwe find the ritual of living.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Ways Poets Go Crazy (audio only)", "view_node": "/poem/ways-poets-go-crazy-audio-only", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/c-k-williams\" hreflang=\"und\">C.

I stay at his palace and share my room with two other talents. The three of us are unique and in demand. We are each 10 stories tall. We do what we do and what no one else does. Our limbs are a hike, folding path over glory. I wake up one morning and look out the window. An ocean has appeared. Its surface, 10 stories above me, the sun just arriving. A reef reaching towards me through clear blue water crystallized by morning's shimmer. A surface broken by shadows, underneath what appear to be cliffs. The ocean bottom, as deep as I am from the surface, 10 stories below. I am 10 stories above. 10 is where we meet. I look down. A horse is swimming into view. Its mane whipped by morning wind-water. The horse is alone for an instant. Free for a few kicks. Then a rider appears on its back. Instantly not free. The rider is a tourist on an underwater swimming tour, where the horse does all the swimming. I turn my head and see more enter the frame. 10 more. 10 signifying more than height, horse or story. Against the blue-green water, the ocean bottom is visible. Horse and rider float. 10 stories above me. In slow-motion, sounds like. But that's because storyteller remains in the story. They swim away. The water clears as if almost to disappear. My eyes adjust and see 10 surfer punks relaxing at the bottom of the ocean. They wear cut-off jeans and shorts. Some have t-shirts some don't. They are relaxing in chaise lounges on the bottom of the floor, getting sun tans through the crystal clear water. Every few seconds, one of them swims up to the surface for a gulp of air and swims back down. The scene is a constant yo-yoing of bodies going up and down. Swimming with hands to sides, long hair flowing behind, air bubbles tracing their destination. Up and down. Up and down. A hypnosis of breath and water. A reward at bottom and at top. A kind of water that lets this happen. A kind of animal doing what nothing else can.</p> "}], "pager": {"current_page": 479, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
