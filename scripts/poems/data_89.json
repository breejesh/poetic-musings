The tree had me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The minute it was left with me alone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It caught me up as if I were the fish</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And it the fishpole. So I was translated</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To loud cries from my brother of 'Let go!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Don't you know anything, you girl? Let go!'</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I, with something of the baby grip</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Acquired ancestrally in just such trees</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When wilder mothers than our wildest now</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hung babies out on branches by the hands</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To dry or wash or tan, I don't know which,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(You'll have to ask an evolutionist)-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I held on uncomplainingly for life.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My brother tried to make me laugh to help me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'What are you doing up there in those grapes?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Don't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I mean, they won't pick you if you don't them.'</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Much danger of my picking anything!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By that time I was pretty well reduced</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Now you know how it feels,' my brother said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That when it thinks it has escaped the fox</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By growing where it shouldn't-on a birch,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where a fox wouldn't think to look for it-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Just then come you and I to gather it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only you have the advantage of the grapes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In one way: you have one more stem to cling by,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And promise more resistance to the picker.'</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">One by one I lost off my hat and shoes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And still I clung. I let my head fall back,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And shut my eyes against the sun, my ears</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Against my brother's nonsense; 'Drop,' he said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'I'll catch you in my arms. It isn't far.'</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down.'</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grim silence on my part as I sank lower,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">'Why, if she isn't serious about it!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hold tight awhile till I think what to do.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I'll bend the tree down and let you down by it.'</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I don't know much about the letting down;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But once I felt ground with my stocking feet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the world came revolving back to me,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Before I straightened them and brushed the bark off.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My brother said: 'Don't you weigh anything?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Try to weigh something next time, so you won't</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Be run off with by birch trees into space.'</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It wasn't my not weighing anything</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So much as my not knowing anything-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My brother had been nearer right before.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I had not taken the first step in knowledge;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I had not learned to let go with the hands,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As still I have not learned to with the heart,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And have no wish to with the heart-nor need,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That I can see.

My father was buried down the road, in a box his other son selected, the ashes of his third wife in a brass urn that he will hold in the crook of his arm forever. At the reception, after his funeral, I got mean on four cups of Lime Sherbet Punch. When the man who was not my father divorced my mother, I stopped being related to him. <em>These things are complicated</em>, says the Talmud. When he died, I couldn\u2019t prove it. I couldn\u2019t get a death certificate. <em>These things are complicated</em>, says the Health Department. Their names remain on the deed to the house.
