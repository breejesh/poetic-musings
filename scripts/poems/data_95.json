Whether she might</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">come to say it, let\u2019s not insure.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0But it is here it commences.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The thickenings of lymph,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the persistent shyness, the passions.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0It is endless. As symbol, luxury,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">she finds, and poverty are the same.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0She listens prodigally. Correlatives</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 appear, disappear. She lacquers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">them. But poverty, she finds, is,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0in act, in thought, a word, to her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0not otherwise permitted, real.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Articulacy then was of elbows</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0and knees. The spirit never quite</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">levels between her mother and</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0the woman on the blue tarp,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but they touch hands. The mother</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">communes with nearly every one.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The child rears her ugly head,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">quizzical. Recrudescence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0that\u2019s luscious, shutting down</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">institutes. Speak, she says, speak,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">my heart is gelatin. If anything luxe</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0is, it is this severe</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">unthinkable audio. Palatial,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0she says. In futures glorious</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and systematic the word ATELIER</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0will come to describe this</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0pure fragment, this collapse of lines.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Curvatures, she thinks. Conniptions.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0The dusty, colloidal elegance, she</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">thinks, of air. She views it with her</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0double-eye, sculptural aspect.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A powdery substance overlays things,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">steady music. It is here she comes to</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0comprehend, tender,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">later, smell it. We call it in the vulgar</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">money. Speak, she speaks. The humors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">reside not in but a quarter of an inch</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0away from her, settling sometimes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as sweat. She was extraordinarily</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0vulnerable, with not even a</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">rotten core. What might coerce her</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0to nostalgia. Hot tea chilled jelly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">dissolves. No quality here. It is</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0nothing and the saw. The recrude-</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">scence is luscious, shuts down law.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0It began as tendency. Petty crime.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Delirium of touching. Passion of</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the silk. Subjective correlatives.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0Desire, dark wishes, ossifications,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0and abbreviations of sound. The</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">refusal to dance, the turning away</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0inside the apostrophe. Meditative</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">processional. It got heavy. She</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0lacquered it. She viewed it with her</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0vulgar eye. She lacquered it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0No delicacy obtained. She put it</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0away in its pure future, glittering</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">mound. The opposite of hot tea</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0and a biscuit. Lacquer on it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Endless, mostly. Difficult to discern.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0The conniptions. Cognitions. This kind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of traffick is difficult to curb. But no,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0it did not affect her. No one was</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0spirited away. This was not the meadow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0in which she grew. No one haggled,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 no one withdrew.

class=\"long-line\">I was caught once through an open bathrobe</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">trying to see my father\u2019s penis</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">My stepmother never forgot</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">You were trying to look at him, she said.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I was not given toys books anything</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Stuffed animals</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Bows ribbons anything that may be attached to a little girl</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I was also my mother\u2019s sounding board for her adult problems</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">with my Dad</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Constantly instructed to call the police</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">when he hit her</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The only thing my parents could figure out to do together</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">for some small infraction was to give me punishment</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">2 weeks</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So I never knew the nurturance</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">that girls got</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">My adult life has duplicated this</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">always to blame</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">always outside</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">refusing to see my little girl</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">On occasion my mother sent me to the store to get candy</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Things that she liked</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Fire balls</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Reese's peanut butter cups</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Kit Kat bars</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Black licorice</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Sometimes red which I liked</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Twizzlers</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I remember once chewing a pack of red Twizzlers as an adult</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the red stem hung out of my mouth</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A friend at the time exclaimed</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">You're such a little girl \u2026</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And once when I was with a woman</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Someone looked on and said oh</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Your little girl is out</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In relationships too I was never</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the little girl</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In fact in most of them I rescued radically immature women</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I was their mother caretaker</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the one with all responsibility</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And of course when it ended I was always to blame</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Everything to me lies around class race gender lines</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Even in so called evolved communities</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Even with people of color</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I always know no one would treat a white skinned woman or a man the way I've been treated</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In colleges where I teach</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I'm always aware of the hierarchy</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">People screaming about diversity</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I moan complain</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">How the Aids narrative only belongs to men</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">They never ask women</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Black women</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">As if Aids didn't happen to us</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Our fathers brothers sons nephews</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Cousins acquaintances</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The black gay boys in the choir</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">became our disappeared</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I

class=\"long-line\">and bury the dead black boys</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">families wouldn't recognize</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">These men showed up as the

ups</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019m reminded of Idi Amin when he cast out foreigners</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and Forest Whitaker in the film The Last King of Scotland/when he played him.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And to see it is again</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">at rallies, at protests, they show the coat hangers and crude instruments</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">women were forced to use in back alley abortions</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We say never again but taking away women\u2019s choice</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and Planned Parenthood it is again.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Today started out in an argument with a so called fan</span></p>\n<p><span

sports</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">because they said sports made her more of a dyke</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It murdered my student inside because she was an athlete</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Yeah so the white guy I argued with about my book</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">said he was just giving me some good advice</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">from his experience as an empath</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I said I don\u2019t need your advice</span></p>\n<p><span

class=\"long-line\">I\u2019ll offer this non-sequitur</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Winnie Mandela died a few weeks ago</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">She had great impact on me</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I read she was nobility</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But then of course the difference between her and say</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">how Princess Diana was treated</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Everyone accepted and loved Diana\u2019s silent/passive status</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">She was allowed to be gorgeous</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">No one ever associated her with that dirty colonial stain</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There are moments in that recent Winnie Mandela doc that stand out to me</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">where she buried her face in her hands and screamed out</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">as I have so many times, \u201cI\u2019ve been betrayed\u201d/the other moment</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">was when she said she was the only ANC member</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">brought to
