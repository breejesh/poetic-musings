Inhaler sip. Eight more times.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Times seven. Again. Times sixty days.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The world shimmered in blue, the faces of my son, my husband</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and our girls, cast in that same blue.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">One morning or one night, or the next day, or the night that was yesterday</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and before, tomorrow, I dreamt of running at full speed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">down our street, past the school, toward the bayou ten blocks away.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The banks were filling with rain, ready to break over the edge</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of the concrete embarkment, and I ran so hard every part of me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">ached and I knew that this feeling, familiar, happened yesterday,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">today, and tomorrow.

The laughter, her sigh.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Underneath it all was this color, not an earthly blue, blue of ocean,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">precious stone or gem cut into rock, a sky flanking a horizon. No.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">This blue which was not blue was the color of sacred, deep,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with a center to it, blood of childbirth, the whitened lips of the dead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the infant\u2019s purple wail\u2014</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">all of it mixed together, long and unraveling, a cruel silence</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with a terrifying bell inside.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I rested my head back on the chair and stared at the sky</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that was no longer the sky.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I blinked and felt close to that color\u2014this underwater, the blue eggs,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">blue veins on an infant\u2019s foot, the black feather of a blue jay that feigned</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">blue, the blue mouth of a glacier.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Was this what ran parallel and twinned to our lives,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a universe linked with a battered rope to this one,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">where I had died, and hanging by a thread</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to the universe where I lived.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The giant bell in its cruel silence behind the blue,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and my rollercoaster heartbeat readying me for the terrifying drop</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to the ground. I longed to hear the bell.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I would not share it, only save it inside my body,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and never, even to my worst enemies, (but is that true?)</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">tell anyone the sound it made that killed small parts</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">all at once with a blow.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I opened my eyes, heavy pinned.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I had already heard the bell.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I had already imagined my children without me.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I sat feeling the holes of it,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">growing cold.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Light overhead grew brighter</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">until wind threw the branches together,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a dark shadow enveloping our family.</span></p>\n\n<p><span
