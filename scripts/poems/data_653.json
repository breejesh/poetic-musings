My job was stirring\nthe rinse.  The troll hummed.  Its wringer stuck\nout each piece of laundry like a tongue-- \n\nsocks, aprons, Daddy's shirts, my brother's \nfunny (I see London) underpants.  \nThe whole family came past, mashed flat \nas Bugs Bunny pancaked by a train. \nThey flopped into the rinse tub and learned\nto swim, relaxing, almost arms and legs  \nagain. I helped the transformation  \nwith a stick we picked up one summer \n\nat the lake.  Wave-peeled, worn to gray, inch \nthick, it was a first rate stirring stick.\nApprenticed on my stool, I sang a rhyme \nof Simple Simon gone afishing \nand poked the clothes around the cauldron\nand around.  The wringer was risky.\nTouch it with just your fingertip,\nit would pull you in and spit you out\n\nflat as a dishrag.  It grabbed Mother \nonce--rolled her arm right to the elbow.\nBut she kept her head, flipped the lever\nto reverse, and got her arm back, pretty\nand round as new.  This was a story\nfrom Before.  Still, I seemed to see it--\nmy mother brave as a movie star, \nthe flattened arm pumping up again, \n\nlike Popeye's.  I fished out the rinsing \nswimmers, one by one.  Mother fed them\nback to the wringer and they flopped, flat,\ninto baskets.  Then the machine peed \nright on the floor; the foamy water \ncurled around the drain and gurgled down.  \nMother, under the slanting basement \ndoors, where it was darkest, reached up that \n\nmiraculous arm and raised the lid.\nSunlight fell down the stairs, shouting \n\"This way out!\"  There was the day, an Easter \negg cut-out of grass and trees and sky.  \nMother lugged the baskets up.  Too short \nto reach the clothesline, I would slide down \nthe bulkhead or sit and drum my heels \nto aggravate the troll (Who's that trit-\n\ntrotting...) and watch.  Thus I learned the rules \nof hanging clothes: Shirts went upside down, \npinned at the placket and seams.  Sheets hung \nlike hammocks; socks were a toe-bitten \nrow.  Underpants, indecently mixed, \nflapped chainwise, cheek to cheek.  Mother\ntook hold of the clothespole like a knight \ncouching his lance and propped the sagging \n\nline up high, to catch the wind.  We all\nwere airborne then, sleeves puffed out round  \nas sausages, bottoms billowing,\nlegs in arabesque.  Our heaviness\nwas scattered into air, our secrets\nbleached back to white.  Mother stood easing \nher back and smiled, queen of the backyard\nand all that flapping crowd.  For a week\n\nnow, each day, we'd put on this jubilee,    \nwalk inside it, wash with it, and sleep\nin its sweetness.  At night, best of all,\nI'd see with closed eyes the sheets aloft,\npajamas dancing, pillow cases \nshaking out white signals in the sun,  \nand my mother with the basket, bent\nand then rising, stretching up her arms.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Presbyopia", "view_node": "/poem/presbyopia", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/sarah-getty\" hreflang=\"und\">Sarah Getty</a>", "field_date_published": "1996", "body": " <pre>\nOld eyes, but wiser, says the Greek.
