cabinet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">i snagged duck tape &amp; ceramic glue. pieced each beast</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">back to their intended journey.\u00a0 because that afternoon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">when my father returned from work i confessed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">&amp; he sat the jar on the counter only to fill it with</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pastries. how the cracks of imperfection mended by</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">my hands laid jagged. chipped paint sliced across a rhino\u2019s neck.</span><br
