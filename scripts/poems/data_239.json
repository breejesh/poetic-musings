They talked, they joked, and then a silence\nthat made me open my eyes. After a longer pause, they asked him\nto please leave. I now saw the boy was black and I registered\nan expression that was slow rain coming down hard as he grabbed\nhis backpack swinging it so fiercely, it almost hit one of the girls.\nAs he walked away, they laughed past him. Their laughter\nwas the long shadow that followed him for years, their laughter\nforced him to round the corner, almost gone from view.\nBefore he disappeared, he yelled, \u201cBitch,\u201d but the memory\nof him left not a trace. The girls continued to sing except now\nthere were thorns falling on the imagined grass, some of which\nlanded close to me. When I sat up, I felt a strong kick inside me.\nMy boy would be here soon.
