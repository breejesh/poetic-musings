I cannot say from the image if the soldier is smiling, too few pixels to tell. Barely do the prisoner's elegant feet touch the floor. In another nude photograph a prisoner with shorter hair cowers against a wall while two dogs whose leashes are held by soldiers examine him.

Or Mahalia Jackson has genius. The man I am with is trying to make a distinction. I am uncomfortable with his need to make this distinction because his inquiry begins to approach subtle shades of racism, classism, or sexism. It is hard to know which. Mahalia Jackson never finished the eighth grade, or Mahalia's genius is based on the collision of her voice with her spirituality. True spirituality is its own force. I am not sure how to respond to all this. I change the subject instead.</p><p>We have just seen George Wein's documentary,\u00a0<em>Louis Armstrong at Newport, 1971</em>. In the auditorium a room full of strangers listened to Mahalia Jackson sing \"Let There Be Peace on Earth\" and stood up and gave a standing ovation to a movie screen. Her clarity of vision crosses thirty years to address intimately each of us. It is as if her voice has always been dormant within us, waiting to be awakened, even though \"it had to go through its own lack of answers, through terrifying silence, (and) through the thousand darknesses of murderous speech.\"</p><p>Perhaps Mahalia, like Paul Celan, has already lived all our lives for us. Perhaps that is the definition of genius. Hegel says, \"Each man hopes and believes he is better than the world which is his, but the man who is better merely expresses this same world better than the others.\" Mahalia Jackson sings as if it is the last thing she intends to do.
