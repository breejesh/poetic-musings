uncessant labors see \nCrowned from some single herb or tree, \nWhose short and narrow-verg\u00e8d shade \nDoes prudently their toils upbraid; \nWhile all the flowers and trees do close \nTo weave the garlands of repose. \n\nFair Quiet, have I found thee here, \nAnd Innocence, thy sister dear! \nMistaken long, I sought you then \nIn busy companies of men: \nYour sacred plants, if here below, \nOnly among the plants will grow; \nSociety is all but rude, \nTo this delicious solitude. \n\nNo white nor red was ever seen \nSo amorous as this lovely green; \nFond lovers, cruel as their flame, \nCut in these trees their mistress' name. \nLittle, alas, they know or heed, \nHow far these beauties hers exceed! \nFair trees! wheresoe'er your barks I wound \nNo name shall but your own be found. \n\nWhen we have run our passion's heat, \nLove hither makes his best retreat: \nThe gods who mortal beauty chase, \nStill in a tree did end their race. \nApollo hunted Daphne so, \nOnly that she might laurel grow, \nAnd Pan did after Syrinx speed, \nNot as a nymph, but for a reed. \n\nWhat wondrous life is this I lead! \nRipe apples drop about my head; \nThe luscious clusters of the vine \nUpon my mouth do crush their wine; \nThe nectarine and curious peach \nInto my hands themselves do reach; \nStumbling on melons as I pass, \nInsnared with flowers, I fall on grass.\n\nMeanwhile the mind, from pleasure less, \nWithdraws into its happiness: \nThe mind, that ocean where each kind \nDoes straight its own resemblance find; \nYet it creates, transcending these, \nFar other worlds, and other seas; \nAnnihilating all that's made \nTo a green thought in a green shade. \n\nHere at the fountain's sliding foot, \nOr at some fruit-tree's mossy root, \nCasting the body's vest aside, \nMy soul into the boughs does glide: \nThere like a bird it sits and sings, \nThen whets and combs its silver wings; \nAnd, till prepared for longer flight, \nWaves in its plumes the various light. \n\nSuch was that happy garden-state, \nWhile man there walked without a mate: \nAfter a place so pure and sweet, \nWhat other help could yet be meet! \nBut 'twas beyond a mortal's share \nTo wander solitary there: \nTwo paradises 'twere in one \nTo live in Paradise alone. \n\nHow well the skillful gard'ner drew \nOf flowers and herbs this dial new; \nWhere from above the milder sun \nDoes through a fragrant zodiac run; \nAnd, as it works, th' industrious bee \nComputes its time as well as we. \nHow could such sweet and wholesome hours \nBe reckoned but with herbs and flowers!</pre>\n "},

string.\nHence with denial vain and coy excuse:\nSo may some gentle Muse\nWith lucky words favour my destined urn,\nAnd as he passes turn,\nAnd bid fair peace be to my sable shroud!\n         For we were nursed upon the self-same hill,\nFed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill;\nTogether both, ere the high lawns appeared\nUnder the opening eyelids of the Morn,\nWe drove a-field, and both together heard\nWhat time the grey-fly winds her sultry horn,\nBattening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,\nOft till the star that rose at evening bright\nToward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.\nMeanwhile the rural ditties were not mute;\nTempered to the oaten flute,\nRough Satyrs danced, and Fauns with cloven heel\nFrom the glad sound would not be absent long;\nAnd old Damoetas loved to hear our song.\n         But, oh! the heavy change, now thou art gone,\nNow thou art gone and never must return!\nThee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves,\nWith wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown,\nAnd all their echoes, mourn.\nThe willows, and the hazel copses green,\nShall now no more be seen\nFanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.\nAs killing as the canker to the rose,\nOr taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,\nOr frost to flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear,\nWhen first the white-thorn blows;\nSuch, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd's ear.\n         Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep\nClosed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?\nFor neither were ye playing on the steep\nWhere your old bards, the famous Druids, lie,\nNor on the shaggy top of Mona high,\nNor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream.\nAy me! I fondly dream\nRHad ye been there, S . . . for what could that have done?\nWhat could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore,\nThe Muse herself, for her enchanting son,\nWhom universal nature did lament,\nWhen, by the rout that made the hideous roar,\nHis gory visage down the stream was sent,\nDown the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?\n         Alas! what boots it with uncessant care\nTo tend the homely, slighted, shepherd's trade,\nAnd strictly meditate the thankless Muse?\nWere it not better done, as others use,\nTo sport with Amaryllis in the shade,\nOr with the tangles of Neaera's hair?\nFame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise\n(That last infirmity of noble mind)\nTo scorn delights and live laborious days;\nBut, the fair guerdon when we hope to find,\nAnd think to burst out into sudden blaze,\nComes the blind Fury with the abhorred shears,\nAnd slits the thin-spun life. \"But not the praise,\"\nPhoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears:\n\"Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,\nNor in the glistering foil\nSet off to the world, nor in broad rumour lies,\nBut lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes\nAnd perfect witness of all-judging Jove;\nAs he pronounces lastly on each deed,\nOf so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.\"\n         O fountain Arethuse, and thou honoured flood,\nSmooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds,\nThat strain I heard was of a higher mood.\nBut now my oat proceeds,\nAnd listens to the Herald of the Sea,\nThat came in Neptune's plea.\nHe asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,\nWhat hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?\nAnd questioned every gust of rugged wings\nThat blows from off each beaked promontory.\nThey knew not of his story;\nAnd sage Hippotades their answer brings,\nThat not a blast was from his dungeon strayed:\nThe air was calm, and on the level brine\nSleek Panope with all her sisters played.\nIt was that fatal and perfidious bark,\nBuilt in the eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,\nThat sunk so low that sacred head of thine.\n         Next, Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,\nHis mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge,\nInwrought with figures dim, and on the edge\nLike to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe.\n\"Ah! who hath reft,\" quoth he, \"my dearest pledge?\"\nLast came, and last did go,\nThe Pilot of the Galilean Lake;\nTwo massy keys he bore of metals twain.\n(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain).\nHe shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:\u2014\n\"How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,\nEnow of such as, for their bellies' sake,\nCreep, and intrude, and climb into the fold!\nOf other care they little reckoning make\nThan how to scramble at the shearers' feast,\nAnd shove away the worthy bidden guest.\nBlind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold\n A sheep-hook, or have learnt aught else the least\nThat to the faithful herdman's art belongs!\nWhat recks it them? What need they? They are sped:\nAnd, when they list, their lean and flashy songs\nGrate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;\nThe hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,\nBut, swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw,\nRot inwardly, and foul contagion spread;\nBesides what the grim wolf with privy paw\nDaily devours apace, and nothing said.\nBut that two-handed engine at the door\nStands ready to smite once, and smite no more.\"\n         Return, Alpheus; the dread voice is past\nThat shrunk thy streams; return Sicilian Muse,\nAnd call the vales, and bid them hither cast\nTheir bells and flowerets of a thousand hues.\nYe valleys low, where the mild whispers use\nOf shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,\nOn whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks,\nThrow hither all your quaint enamelled eyes,\nThat on the green turf suck the honeyed showers,\nAnd purple all the ground with vernal flowers.\nBring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,\nThe tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,\nThe white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet,\nThe glowing violet,\nThe musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,\nWith cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,\nAnd every flower that sad embroidery wears;\nBid amaranthus all his beauty shed,\nAnd daffadillies fill their cups with tears,\nTo strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies.\nFor so, to interpose a little ease,\nLet our frail thoughts dally with false surmise,\nAy me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas\nWash far away, where'er thy bones are hurled;\nWhether beyond the stormy Hebrides,\nWhere thou perhaps under the whelming tide\nVisit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;\nOr whether thou, to our moist vows denied,\nSleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,\nWhere the great Vision of the guarded mount\nLooks toward Namancos and Bayona's hold.\nLook homeward, Angel, now, and melt with ruth:\nAnd, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth.\n         Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more,\nFor Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,\nSunk though he be beneath the watery floor.\nSo sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,\nAnd yet anon repairs his drooping head,\nAnd tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore\nFlames in the forehead of the morning sky:\nSo Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,\nThrough the dear might of Him that walked the waves,\nWhere, other groves and other streams along,\nWith nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,\nAnd hears the unexpressive nuptial song,\nIn the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.\nThere entertain him all the Saints above,\nIn solemn troops, and sweet societies,\nThat Sing, and singing in their glory move,\nAnd wipe the tears for ever from his eyes.\nNow, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;\nHenceforth thou art the Genius of the shore,\nIn thy large recompense, and shalt be good\nTo all that wander in that perilous flood.\n         Thus sang the uncouth swain to the oaks and rills,\nWhile the still morn went out with sandals grey:\nHe touched the tender stops of various quills,\nWith eager thought warbling his Doric lay:\nAnd now the sun had stretched out all the hills,\nAnd now was dropt into the western bay.\nAt last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue:\nTomorrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Quindecagon (audio only)", "view_node": "/poem/quindecagon-audio-only", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/ron-silliman\" hreflang=\"und\">Ron Silliman</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <p>\u00a0</p><p>Click the icon above to listen to this audio poem.</p> "}, {"title": "What [Friends ask us why] (audio only)", "view_node": "/poem/what-friends-ask-us-why-audio-only", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/ron-silliman\" hreflang=\"und\">Ron Silliman</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <p>\u00a0</p><p>Click the icon above to listen to this audio poem.</p><p>\u00a0</p> "}, {"title": "Going Down Hill on a Bicycle", "view_node": "/poem/going-down-hill-bicycle", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/henry-charles-beeching\" hreflang=\"und\">Henry Charles Beeching</a>", "field_date_published": "1895", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\"><em>A Boy's Song</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">With lifted feet, hands still,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I am poised, and down the hill</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Dart, with heedful mind;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The air goes by in a wind.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Swifter and yet more swift,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till the heart with a mighty lift</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Makes the lungs laugh, the throat cry:\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"O bird, see;
