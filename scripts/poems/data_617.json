through the gloom,\nAnd from his smiles arose a sweet perfume--\nA calm ensued, and birds began to sing,\nAnd lo! the sacred muse resumed her wing.\n\nWith frantic joy she chaunted as she flew,\nAnd kiss'd the clement hand that bore her through;\nHer envious foes did from her sight retreat,\nOr prostrate fall beneath her burning feet.\n\n'Twas like a proselyte, allied to Heaven--\nOr rising spirits' boast of sins forgiven,\nWhose shout dissolves the adamant away,\nWhose melting voice the stubborn rocks obey.\n\n'Twas like the salutation of the dove,\nBorne on the zephyr through some lonesome grove,\nWhen Spring returns, and Winter's chill is past,\nAnd vegetation smiles above the blast.\n\n'Twas like the evening of a nuptial pair,\nWhen love pervades the hour of sad despair--\n'Twas like fair Helen's sweet return to Troy,\nWhen every Grecian bosom swell'd with joy.\n\nThe silent harp which on the osiers hung,\nWas then attuned, and manumission sung;\nAway by hope the clouds of fear were driven,\nAnd music breathed my gratitude to Heaven.\n\nHard was the race to reach the distant goal,\nThe needle oft was shaken from the pole;\nIn such distress who could forbear to weep?\nToss'd by the headlong billows of the deep!\n\nThe tantalizing beams which shone so plain,\nWhich turned my former pleasures into pain--\nWhich falsely promised all the joys of fame,\nGave way, and to a more substantial flame.\n\nSome philanthropic souls as from afar,\nWith pity strove to break the slavish bar;\nTo whom my floods of gratitude shall roll,\nAnd yield with pleasure to their soft control.\n\nAnd sure of Providence this work begun--\nHe shod my feet this rugged race to run;\nAnd in despite of all the swelling tide,\nAlong the dismal path will prove my guide.\n\nThus on the dusky verge of deep despair,\nEternal Providence was with me there;\nWhen pleasure seemed to fade on life's gay dawn,\nAnd the last beam of hope was almost gone.</pre>\n "},

out\nWeeping among the ambulances,\n\nAnd each community has its tart, its magical false Helen\nOr at least someone who looks like her, in all the makeup she can muster,\nThe gorgeous mask of whatever

screws,\nHeightens the gloss of each bitter scene\nAnd strikes every key, each word rings out\nOver our terrified heads like a brass trumpet,\n\nFor this gift is an accordion, the biggest and

wives pile into the waiting cars\n\nJust as we expect, life picks up and goes on\nBut not art: crouched back there like a stalled stallion\nStuffed in its gorgeous music box is the one gift\nThat will not disappear but waits, but bides its time and waits\n\nFor the next time we open it, that magical false structure\nInside whose artifice is the lesson, buried alive,\nOf the grim machinations of the
