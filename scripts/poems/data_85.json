class=\"long-line\">As it flutters, we stand reverently</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for those who can no longer </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and for those who cannot yet.</span><br

great height of their achievements </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">not formidable but inspiring. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Still others humble and hushed as the plains; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">yet their voice embodied in the breeze touches all. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From mountains to marshes to mesas, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">we are united in the embrace of the same two seas. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Invaluable are contrasting beliefs </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">bridged by curiosity and a common\u00a0desire for betterment. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A miscellany not of problems but possible solutions are we. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speak up, I implore you,

Death is a comfort because it says, <em>Transform but don\u2019t hurry</em>. There is a tenderness to growing older and we are listening for it. Steadier ways to move through the world and we are learning them. A way to touch your own body. A touch that says, <em>Dig deeper.</em> There, in the ground, there is our memory.
