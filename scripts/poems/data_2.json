hear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hardly a man is now alive </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who remembers that famous day and year.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He said to his friend, \u201cIf the British march</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By land or sea from the town to-night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the North-Church-tower, as a signal-light,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One if by land, and two if by sea;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I on the opposite shore will be,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ready to ride and spread the alarm</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through every Middlesex village and farm,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the country-folk to be up and to arm.\u201d</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then he said \u201cGood night!\u201d and with muffled oar</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Just as the moon rose over the bay,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where swinging wide at her moorings lay</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Somerset, British man-of-war:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A phantom ship, with each mast and spar</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Across the moon, like a prison-bar,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And a huge black hulk, that was magnified </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By its own reflection in the tide.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile, his friend, through alley and street</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wanders and watches with eager ears, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Till in the silence around him he hears </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The muster of men at the barrack door,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the measured tread of the grenadiers </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Marching down to their boats on the shore.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Then he climbed to the tower of the church,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the belfry-chamber overhead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And startled the pigeons from their perch</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the sombre rafters, that round him made</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Masses and moving shapes of shade,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To the highest window in the wall,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where he paused to listen and look down</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A moment on the roofs of the town,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the moonlight flowing over all.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In their night-encampment on the hill, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wrapped in silence so deep and still </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That he could hear, like a sentinel\u2019s tread, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The watchful night-wind, as it went </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Creeping along from tent to tent, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And seeming to whisper, \u201cAll is well!\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A moment only he feels the spell </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of the lonely belfry and the dead; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For suddenly all his thoughts are bent </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On a shadowy something far away, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where the river widens to meet the bay,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A line of black, that bends and floats </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now he patted his horse\u2019s side, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now gazed on the landscape far and near, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then impetuous stamped the earth, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But mostly he watched with eager search </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The belfry-tower of the old North Church, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As it rose above the graves on the hill, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And lo! as he looks, on the belfry\u2019s height, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A second lamp in the belfry burns!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The fate of a nation was riding that night; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Kindled the land into flame with its heat.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He has left the village and mounted the steep,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And under the alders, that skirt its edge,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It was twelve by the village clock</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He heard the crowing of the cock, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the barking of the farmer\u2019s dog, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And felt the damp of the river-fog,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That rises when the sun goes down.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It was one by the village clock,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he galloped into Lexington. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He saw the gilded weathercock </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Swim in the moonlight as he passed, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gaze at him with a spectral glare, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As if they already stood aghast </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At the bloody work they would look upon.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It was two by the village clock,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he came to the bridge in Concord town. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He heard the bleating of the flock, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the twitter of birds among the trees, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And felt the breath of the morning breeze</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Blowing over the meadows brown.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And one was safe and asleep in his bed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who at the bridge would be first to fall,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who that day would be lying dead,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pierced by a British musket-ball.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">You know the rest.

We should explore</span><br />The origins of a derogatory word like <em>spade</em> as well as the word<br />For feeling alone in polite company. And also the implications<br />Of calling someone who is not your brother or sister,<br /><br />Brother or Sister. So little is known of our past, we can imagine<br />Damn near anything. When I say maybe slaves held Spades<br />Tournaments on the anti-cruise ships bound for the Colonies,<br />You say when our ancestors were cooped on those ships<br /><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They were not yet slaves.

loud;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And but for fear it is not so,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The wild unrest that lives in woe</div><div>Would dote and pore on yonder cloud</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>That rises upward always higher,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And onward drags a labouring breast,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And topples round the dreary west,</div><div>A looming bastion fringed with fire.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XVI</div><div>What words are these have falle'n from me?</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Can calm despair and wild unrest</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Be tenants of a single

knows no more of transient form</div><div>In her deep self, than some dead lake</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>That holds the shadow of a lark</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Hung in the shadow of a heaven?</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Or has the shock, so harshly given,</div><div>Confused me like the unhappy bark</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>That strikes by night a craggy shelf,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And staggers blindly ere she sink?</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And stunn'd me from my power to think</div><div>And all my knowledge of myself;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And made me that delirious

plan?</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XVII</div><div>Thou comest, much wept for: such a breeze</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Compell'd thy canvas, and my prayer</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Was as the whisper of an air</div><div>To breathe thee over lonely seas.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>For I in spirit saw thee move</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Thro' circles of the bounding sky,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Week after week: the days go by:</div><div>Come quick, thou bringest all I love.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Henceforth, wherever thou may'st roam,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0My blessing, like a line of

pain,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And slowly forms the firmer mind,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Treasuring the look it cannot find,</div><div>The words that are not heard again.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XIX</div><div>The Danube to the Severn gave</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The darken'd heart that beat no more;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0They laid him by the pleasant shore,</div><div>And in the hearing of the wave.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>There twice a day the Severn fills;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The salt sea-water passes by,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And hushes half the babbling Wye,</div><div>And makes a silence in the hills.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The Wye is hush'd nor moved along,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And hush'd my deepest grief of all,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0When fill'd with tears that cannot fall,</div><div>I brim with sorrow drowning song.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The tide flows down, the wave again</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Is vocal in its wooded walls;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0My deeper anguish also falls,</div><div>And I can speak a little then.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XX</div><div>The lesser griefs that may be said,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0That breathe a thousand tender vows,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Are but as servants in a house</div><div>Where lies the master newly dead;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Who speak their feeling as it is,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And weep the fulness from the mind:</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0`It will be hard,' they say, `to find</div><div>Another service such as this.'</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>My lighter moods are like to these,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0That out of words a comfort win;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0But there are other griefs within,</div><div>And tears that at their fountain freeze;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>For by the hearth the children sit</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Cold in that atmosphere of Death,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And scarce endure to draw the breath,</div><div>Or like to noiseless phantoms flit;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>But open converse is there none,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0So much the vital spirits sink</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0To see the vacant chair, and think,</div><div>'How good! how kind! and he is gone.'</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XXI</div><div>I sing to him that rests below,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And, since the grasses round me wave,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0I take the grasses of the grave,</div><div>And make them pipes whereon to blow.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>The traveller hears me now and then,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And sometimes harshly will he speak:</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0`This fellow would make weakness weak,</div><div>And melt the waxen hearts of men.'</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Another answers, `Let him be,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0He loves to make parade of pain</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0That with his piping he may gain</div><div>The praise that comes to constancy.'</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>A third is wroth: `Is this an hour</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0For private sorrow's barren song,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0When more and more the people throng</div><div>The chairs and thrones of civil power?</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>'A time to sicken and to swoon,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0When Science reaches forth her arms</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0To feel from world to world, and charms</div><div>Her secret from the latest moon?'</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Behold, ye speak an idle thing:</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Ye never knew the sacred dust:</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0I do but sing because I must,</div><div>And pipe but as the linnets sing:</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And one is glad; her note is gay,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0For now her little ones have ranged;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And one is sad; her note is changed,</div><div>Because her brood is stol'n away.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XXII</div><div>The path by which we twain did go,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Which led by tracts that pleased us well,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Thro' four sweet years arose and fell,</div><div>From flower to flower, from snow to snow:</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And we with singing cheer'd the way,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And, crown'd with all the season lent,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0From April on to April went,</div><div>And glad at heart from May to May:</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>But where the path we walk'd began</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0To slant the fifth autumnal slope,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0As we descended following Hope,</div><div>There sat the Shadow fear'd of man;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Who broke our fair companionship,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And spread his mantle dark and cold,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And wrapt thee formless in the fold,</div><div>And dull'd the murmur on thy lip,</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And bore thee where I could not see</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Nor follow, tho' I walk in haste,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And think, that somewhere in the waste</div><div>The Shadow sits and waits for me.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XXIII</div><div>Now, sometimes in my sorrow shut,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Or breaking into song by fits,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Alone, alone, to where he sits,</div><div>The Shadow cloak'd from head to foot,</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Who keeps the keys of all the creeds,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0I wander, often falling lame,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And looking back to whence I came,</div><div>Or on to where the pathway leads;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And crying, How changed from where it ran</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Thro' lands where not a leaf was dumb;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0But all the lavish hills would hum</div><div>The murmur of a happy Pan:</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>When each by turns was guide to each,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And Fancy light from Fancy caught,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And Thought leapt out to wed with Thought</div><div>Ere Thought could wed itself with Speech;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And all we met was fair and good,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And all was good that Time could bring,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And all the secret of the Spring</div><div>Moved in the chambers of the blood;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And many an old philosophy</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0On Argive heights divinely sang,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And round us all the thicket rang</div><div>To many a flute of Arcady.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XXIV</div><div>And was the day of my delight</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0As pure and perfect as I say?</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The very source and fount of Day</div><div>Is dash'd with wandering isles of night.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>If all was good and fair we met,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0This earth had been the Paradise</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0It never look'd to human eyes</div><div>Since our first Sun arose and set.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And is it that the haze of grief</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Makes former gladness loom so great?</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The lowness of the present state,</div><div>That sets the past in this relief?</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Or that the past will always win</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0A glory from its being far;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And orb into the perfect star</div><div>We saw not, when we moved therein?</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XXV</div><div>I know that this was Life,\u2014the track</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Whereon with equal feet we fared;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And then, as now, the day prepared</div><div>The daily burden for the back.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>But this it was that made me move</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0As light as carrier-birds in air;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0I loved the weight I had to bear,</div><div>Because it needed help of Love:</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Nor could I weary, heart or limb,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0When mighty Love would cleave in twain</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The lading of a single pain,</div><div>And part it, giving half to him.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XXVI</div><div>Still onward winds the dreary way;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0I with it; for I long to prove</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0No lapse of moons can canker Love,</div><div>Whatever fickle tongues may say.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>And if that eye which watches guilt</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0And goodness, and hath power to see</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Within the green the moulder'd tree,</div><div>And towers fall'n as soon as built\u2014</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Oh, if indeed that eye foresee</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Or see (in Him is no before)</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0In more of life true life no more</div><div>And Love the indifference to be,</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Then might I find, ere yet the morn</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Breaks hither over Indian seas,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0That Shadow waiting with the keys,</div><div>To shroud me from my proper scorn.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>XXVII</div><div>I envy not in any moods</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The captive void of noble rage,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The linnet born within the cage,</div><div>That never knew the summer woods:</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>I envy not the beast that takes</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0His license in the field of time,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,</div><div>To whom a conscience never wakes;</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>Nor, what may count itself as blest,</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0The heart that never plighted troth</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;</div><div>Nor any want-begotten rest.</div><div>\u00a0</div><div>I hold it true, whate'er befall;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0I feel it, when I sorrow most;</div><div>\u00a0 \u00a0'Tis better to
