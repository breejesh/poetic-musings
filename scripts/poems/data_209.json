Or the day of marriage.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The difference of our bodies makes for different velocities. But gravity is always attracting, and my higher speed. Cannot outrun the inner fright we seem made of. Though I gesticulate broadly. As in a silent movie. Running after the train, waving goodbye.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Distant galaxies are moving away from us. Friends, lovers, family. Even the sky shifts toward red. Where every clearness is only. A more welcoming slope of the night. And I don't remember why I opened the door.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mouth full of moans, you believe the natural state. Is a body at rest. And close your eyes to the threat of your face disappearing. Without thought or emotion. Into its condition. And I thought I knew you.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Are the complications thinning to a final simplicity? The nearest thing to a straight path in curved space? Clouds of gas slowly collapsing? With only one possible outcome? But unlike a black hole I keep my hair on. As I move toward the unquestionable dark.<br />\n\u00a0</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This dark, Mrs. Ramsay thinks, is perhaps the core of every self. The deep note of existence the ear finds, but cannot hold on to. Across the vicissities of the symphony. Or else this dark could be our shelter in the time of long dominion. And though we are not well suited to the perspectives it opens it is an awesome thing to see. Once you can see it.</p>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 209, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
