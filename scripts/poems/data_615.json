Our hours are long. Our backs bent.\nWe are more gracious than English royalty.\nWe dart amongst the aisles tall as hedgerows.\nWatch us face into the merchandise.\nHow we set up and take apart mannequins\nas if we were performing autopsies.\nA naked body, without pretense, is of no use.\nIt grows late.\nI hear the front metal gate close down.\nWe begin folding the ties correctly according to color.\nThe shirts--Oxfords, broadcloths, pinpoints--\nmust be sized, stacked, or rehashed.\nThe old homosexual removes his right shoe,\nallowing his gigantic bunion to swell.\nThere is the sound of cash being counted--\ncoins clinking, bills swishing, numbers whispered--\n<i>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. . .</i>\nWe are changed when the transactions are done--\nolder, dirtier, dwarfed.\nA few late customers gawk in at us.\nWe say nothing. Our silence will not be breached.\nThe lights go off, one by one--\nthe dressing room lights, the mirror lights.\nThen it is very late. How late? Eleven?\nWe move to the gate. It goes up.\nThe gate's grating checkers our cheeks.\nThis is the Mall of America.\nThe light is bright and artificial,\nyet not dissimilar to that found in a Gothic cathedral.\nYou must travel down the long hallways to the exits\nbefore you encounter natural light.\nOne final formality: the manager checks out bags.\nThe old homosexual reaches into his over-the-shoulder leather bag--\nthe one he bought on his European travels \nwith his companion of many years.\nHe finds a stick of lip balm and applies it to his lips\nliberally, as if shellacking them.\nThen he inserts one last breath mint\nand offers one to me. The gesture is fraternal\nand occurs between us many times.\nAt last, we bid each other good night.\nI watch him fade into the many-tiered parking lot,\nwhere the thousands of cars have come\nand are now gone. This is how our day ends.\nThis is how our day always ends.\nSometimes snow falls like rice.\nSee us take to our dimly lit exits,\ndisappearing into the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul;\nMinneapolis is sleek and St. Paul,\nnamed after the man who had to be shown,\nis smaller, older, and somewhat withdrawn.\nBehind us, the moon pauses over the vast egg-like dome of the mall.\nSee us loosening our ties among you.\nWe are alone.\nThere is no longer any need to express ourselves.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Outside", "view_node": "/poem/outside", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/michael-ryan\" hreflang=\"und\">Michael Ryan</a>", "field_date_published": "2004", "body": " <pre>\nThe dead thing mashed into the street\nthe crows are squabbling over isn't\nher, nor are their raucous squawks\nthe quiet cawing from her throat\nthose final hours she couldn't speak.\nBut the racket irks him.\nIt seems a cruel intrusion into grief\nso mute it will never be expressed\nno matter how loud or long the wailing\nhe might do.
