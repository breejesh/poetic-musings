There was Reagan's New Morning for America. Garfield dolls stuck to the backs of windshields with suction cups. At the beginning of the Eighties I was married &amp; at the end i was not. The Civil Rights Movement became kind of quiet. Feminism became kind of quiet. An editor told a woman he couldn't read her poems because it said she was a <i>mother</i> in her bio. Many thought about word materials. Environmentalism got kind of quiet. The earth spirits were not quiet. Buildup of arms. Iran-Contra. Savings &amp; Loan scandal. Tax cuts gave way to library closings. The <i>Challenger</i> went down with the first woman astronaut aboard. People read letters to her on TV. Mini-golf places with purple castles opened on Highway 80 in the Eighties. Chernobyl exploded &amp; the media announced it as a setback for nuclear energy. People ate out more because of tax cuts. i fell in love with a poet. Earth dropped its dark clock. A few wrote outside the margins. Mergers &amp; Acquisitions. The Bay continued to shrink. Many got child-support checks. Many came out. Deconstruction found the moving circle. A few read Lacan. Guns 'n Roses Sweet Child o' Mine. Our daughter drew pictures of trucks with colored fur. She had 24 ear infections in one year so why were you not supposed to write <i>mother</i> in your bio. Many wrote the lyric with word materials. The Soviet Union began to free prisoners. America freed fewer prisoners. Superconductivity. Gorbachev became president instead of something else. One son went to college. We cried. There was no e-mail. Art pierced the image. Blue-rimmed clouds hurried past outside &amp; in. Some wrote about childhood; some wrote about states of mind; some wrote word materials instead of about. Symbolist poetry, by then 120 years old, pushed the dream nature of the world. Hypnotherapy. i began the trance method. In the Eighties, Mt. Tam stayed the same. Mt. Diablo stayed almost the same. Many species died &amp; would not return. At stake. One son started a punk band; he had a one-foot-high purple Mohawk. i listened to the tape with another mother trying to make out the words. Oliver North held up his right hand. Reagan turned off his hearing aid. Sentences fell apart but they had always been a part. Yeltsin. Walesa. Wall comes down. Romania. El Salvador. Noriega. Some elderly folk lived on dog-food when their pensions collapsed. People worried about children, lovers, ex-husbands, jobs. Consciousness stayed alive. Interest rates leapt through the vault of the sky. We cried &amp; cried. We made food &amp; quit smoking. We learned the names of wildflowers &amp; forgot them &amp; relearned them. This was only the beginning. There's so much more to be said in answer to your question.</p> "}, {"title": "Lake on the Hill", "view_node": "/poem/lake-hill", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/james-longenbach\"

/><span class=\"long-line\">Images and memories</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From ruin or from ancient trees,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For I would ask a question of them all.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Beyond that ridge lived Mrs. French, and once</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When every silver candlestick or sconce</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Lit up the dark mahogany and the wine,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A serving-man, that could divine</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That most respected lady's every wish,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Ran and with the garden shears</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Clipped an insolent farmer's ears</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And brought them in a little covered dish.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Some few remembered still when I was young</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A peasant girl commended by a song,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who'd lived somewhere upon that rocky place,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And praised the colour of her face, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And had the greater joy in praising her,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Remembering that, if walked she there,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Farmers jostled at the fair</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So great a glory did the song confer.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And certain men, being maddened by those rhymes,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or else by toasting her a score of times,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rose from the table and declared it right</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To test their fancy by their sight;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But they mistook the brightness of the moon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For the prosaic light of day\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Music had driven their wits astray\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And one was drowned in the great bog of Cloone.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Strange, but the man who made the song was blind;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Yet, now I have considered it, I find</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That nothing strange; the tragedy began</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With Homer that was a blind man,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And Helen has all living hearts betrayed.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">O may the moon and sunlight seem</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">One inextricable beam,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For if I triumph I must make men mad.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I myself created Hanrahan</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And drove him drunk or sober through the dawn</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From somewhere in the neighbouring cottages.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Caught by an old man's juggleries</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He stumbled, tumbled, fumbled to and fro</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And had but broken knees for hire</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And horrible splendour of desire;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I thought it all out twenty years ago:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Good fellows shuffled cards in an old bawn;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And when that ancient ruffian's turn was on</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He so bewitched the cards under his thumb</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That all but the one card became</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A pack of hounds and not a pack of cards,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And that he changed into a hare.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hanrahan rose in frenzy there</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And followed up those baying creatures towards\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">O towards I have forgotten what\u2014enough!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I must recall a man that neither love</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor music nor an enemy's clipped ear</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Could, he was so harried, cheer;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A figure that has grown so fabulous</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">There's not a neighbour left to say</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When he finished his dog's day:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">An ancient bankrupt master of this house.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Before that ruin came, for centuries, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rough men-at-arms, cross-gartered to the knees</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or shod in iron, climbed the narrow stairs, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And certain men-at-arms there were</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whose images, in the Great Memory stored,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come with loud cry and panting breast</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To break upon a sleeper's rest</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">While their great wooden dice beat on the board.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As I would question all, come all who can;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come old, necessitous, half-mounted man;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And bring beauty's blind rambling celebrant;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The red man the juggler sent</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through God-forsaken meadows; Mrs. French,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Gifted with so fine an ear;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The man drowned in a bog's mire,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When mocking Muses chose the country wench.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Did all old men and women, rich and poor,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Who trod upon these rocks or passed this door,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Whether in public or in secret rage</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As I do now against old age?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I have found an answer in those eyes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That are impatient to be gone;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Go therefore; but leave Hanrahan,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For I need all his mighty memories.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Old lecher with a love on every wind,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bring up out of that deep considering mind</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All that you have discovered in the grave,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For it is certain

class=\"long-line\">Does the imagination dwell the most</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Upon a woman won or a woman lost?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If on the lost, admit you turned aside</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From a great labyrinth out of pride,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cowardice, some silly over-subtle thought</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or anything called conscience once;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And that if memory recur, the sun's</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Under eclipse and the day

A book transpires one letter and then one word at a time and nothing about reading can prevent this from happening. For this reason, books are best diluted or read over a good many years. Only things that are consumed endure beyond their shelf life. Nothing is really very different [if you say it] is. I had dinner yesterday at WD-50, which is a restaurant located where the new Fukienese area of Chinatown and the old pickle shops of the defunct Lower East Side almost come into alignment. The restaurant is at 50 Clinton Street and it has a post-Craftsman style d\u00e9cor with bulbous glass lamps that look like fluorescent flower bulbs. The chef's name is Wylie Dufresne. He is young and looks like a cowboy reincarnated as a skateboarder. His father Dewey is also a chef.</p><p>WD-50 is probably the only restaurant in Manhattan that makes you hallucinate the food you are eating while you are eating it. The food can be quite un-foodlike. I ate at the restaurant a few nights ago and afterwards my taste buds felt incongruous and ecstatic. I remember seeing something on another table that looked like dessert and I ordered it. A few moments later there were bonbon sized bits of pineapple on a plate. They had been soaked in something briny and had become pickles. Off to one side of the fruit was smeared what looked like hot fudge sauce except that it was made of ketchup and jalape\u00f1o peppers. The sauce was semi-frozen. The sauce was hot and cold and cold and hot I couldn't tell which. I put the pineapple in my mouth and it was like eating something that was once a vegetable. The chef had sprinkled some salt scented with what looked like dour chips of limes. It was not really necessary to eat the food; one could breathe it. When I put all this in my mouth I tasted so many things I forgot what was in my mouth. Eating at WD-50 is like reading Proust backwards. I looked over at a man at the table next to ours and he had the face of a six-year-old. The ideas of food erase the food itself and then become the food you did not think you were eating. Time passes inordinately or not at all. What is it like to eat an idea or its suggestion? As anyone who has eaten can tell you, the most beautiful memories are memories that one has forgotten how to have. Eating at WD-50 is like having psychoanalysis with a starch, a sugar, or a fat.</p> "}], "pager": {"current_page": 489, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
