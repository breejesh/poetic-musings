Show me a cypress and I'll just go off, but\nI don't want <i>that</i> to be <i>it</i>. Or\nsome kind of poem you can never find your way out of!

Believe in it. I believe in the light and disorder of the word\nrepeated until quote Meaning unquote leeches out of it.

'Cause Amy\nthat's all it is, a word, material in the way the lake through the trees\nis material, that is: insofar, not at all.\nBecause we haven't yet swam in it. See what I mean?\nI see death, I smell death, it moves the hair on my face but\n\nI don't know where it blows from. And in its sources is my power.\nI'm incredibly powerful in my ignorance. I'm incredible, like some kind of fuzzy star.\nThe nonsense of me is the nonsense of death, and\nOh look! Light through the trees on the lake:\n\nthe lake has the kind of calmness\nmy pupils' surface believes...and this is just the thing\nthat the boxed land of shades at the end of the remote\ndoesn't program for: the lake is so kind to me, Amy,\nand I'll be so kind to you, Amy, and so we'll never die:\nthere'll be plenty of us around to \nkeep casting our inquiry \nagainst the crisp light. Light is all like,\nwhat's up, I'm here I'm an angel! &amp; we're\nall: no you're not, that doesn't exist. We all laugh and laugh...\n\nOr cry and cry. The point is, it's words, and so's\ndeath. Even in that silence\nthere's bird calls or meteors or something hurtling\nthrough space: there's matter and light. I've seen it\nthrough the theater of the trees and it was beautiful\n\nIt cut my eyes and I didn't even care\n\nI already had the seeing taken care of. Even in the months I didn't have\na single poem in me, I had this death and this love, and how's\nthat not enough?
