Do they know how he found his life, if from inside it looked like a cage shaped exactly like his body, except two sizes too big, growing as he grew, condensing when he made himself small, and no matter what he did, he couldn't dissolve its borders, not even while he slept. I don't think it let him sleep. At night, fighting sleep, I stay up as if hoping I'll catch wind of something. Tonight, or years ago, a wolf chased a deer past the cabin's front door and out onto lake ice where fate met each discriminately. Borders dissolved, but which one, between predator and prey, or stage and props? Anywhere there is a hole there are traces of arrival and departure. The wind becomes a palimpsest of the creature no longer here, and a song, or is it a cry, emerging from nowhere, on its way to nowhere, passes through until the textures of the earth absorb it entirely. Sound: a body's way of making itself known. Silence: a way of knowing.</p>\n"}, {"title": "Ballad", "view_node": "/poem/ballad-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/diane-seuss\" hreflang=\"und\">Diane Seuss</a>", "field_date_published": "2021", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Oh dream, why do you do me this way?\u00a0 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Again, with the digging, again with the digging up. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Once more with the shovels. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Once more, the shovels full of dirt. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The vault lid.

year </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and always receive the same image: </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I am in bed late at night </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in my house near the airport </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">listening to the jets fly overhead, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a strange wife sleeping beside me. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In my mind the bedroom is an amalgamation </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of various cold medicine commercial sets </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(there is always a box of tissue on the nightstand). </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I know these recurring news articles are clues, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">flaws in the design, though I haven\u2019t figured out </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">how to string them together yet. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I\u2019m noticing that the same people </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">are dying over and over again,57 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for instance, Minnie Pearl </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">who died this year </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for the fourth time in four years. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>III.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Today is the first day of Lent </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and once again I\u2019m not really sure what it is. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How many more years will I let pass </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">before I take the trouble to ask someone? </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It reminds me of this morning </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">when you were getting ready for work. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I was sitting by the space heater, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">numbly watching you dress, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and when you asked why I never wear a robe </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I had so many good reasons </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I didn\u2019t know where to begin. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">If you were cool in high school </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">you didn\u2019t ask too many questions. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You could tell who\u2019d been to last night\u2019s </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">big metal concert by the new t-shirts in the hallways. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You didn\u2019t have to ask </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and that\u2019s what cool was: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the ability to deduce, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to know without asking. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the pressure to simulate coolness </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">means not asking when you don\u2019t know, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">which is why kids grow ever more stupid. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">A yearbook\u2019s endpages, filled with promises </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to stay in touch, stand as proof of the uselessness </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of a teenager\u2019s promise. Not like I\u2019m dying </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for a letter from the class stoner </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">ten years on but\u2026 </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Do you remember the way the girls </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">would call out \u201clove you!\u201d </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">conveniently leaving out the \u201cI\u201d </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as if they didn\u2019t want to commit </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to their own declaration. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I agree that the \u201cI\u201d is a pretty heavy concept </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and hope you won\u2019t get uncomfortable </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">if I should go into some deeper stuff here. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>IV.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There are things I\u2019ve given up on </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like recording funny answering-machine messages. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It\u2019s part of growing older </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and the human race as a group </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">has matured along the same lines. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It seems our comedy dates the quickest. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If you laugh out loud at Shakespeare\u2019s jokes </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I hope you won\u2019t be insulted </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">if I say you\u2019re trying too hard. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Even sketches from the original Saturday Night Live </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">seem slow-witted and obvious now. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">It\u2019s just that our advances are irrepressible. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nowadays little kids can\u2019t even set up lemonade stands. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It makes people too self-conscious about the past, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">though try explaining that to a kid. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019m not saying it should be this way. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">All this new technology </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">will eventually give us new feelings </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that will never completely displace the old ones, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">leaving everyone feeling quite nervous </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and split in two. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">We will travel to Mars </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">even as folks on Earth </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">are still ripping open potato chip </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">bags with their teeth. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Why? I don\u2019t have the time or intelligence </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to make all the connections, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like my friend Gordon </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(this is a true story) </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">who, having grown up in Braintree, Massachusetts, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">had never pictured a brain snagged in a tree </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">until I brought it up. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He\u2019d never broken the name down to its parts. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By then it was too late. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He had moved to Coral Gables. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>V.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The hill out my window is still looking beautiful, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">suffused in a kind of gold national park light, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and it seems to say, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019m sorry the world could not possibly </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">use another poem about Orpheus </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but I\u2019m available if you\u2019re not working </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on a self-portrait or anything. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019m watching my dog have nightmares, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">twitching and whining on the office floor, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and I try to imagine what beast </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">has cornered him in the meadow </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">where his dreams are set. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I\u2019m just letting the day be what it is: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a place for a large number of things </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to gather and interact \u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">not even a place but an occasion, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a reality for real things. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Friends warned me not to get too psychedelic </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or religious with this piece: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cthey won\u2019t accept it if it\u2019s too psychedelic </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or religious,\u201d but these are valid topics </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and I\u2019m the one with the dog twitching on the floor, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">possibly dreaming of me, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that part of me that would beat a dog </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for no good reason, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">no reason that a dog could see. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I am trying to get at something so simple </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that I have to talk plainly </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">so the words don\u2019t disfigure it, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and if it turns out that what I say is untrue, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">then at least let it be harmless </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like a leaky boat in the reeds </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that is bothering no one. </span></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>VI.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I can\u2019t trust the accuracy of my own memories, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">many of them having blended with sentimental </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">telephone and margarine commercials, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">plainly ruined by Madison Avenue, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">though no one seems to call the advertising world </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u201cMadison Avenue\u201d anymore. Have they moved? </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I need an update on this. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But first I have some business to take care of. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I walked out to the hill behind our house </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">which looks positively Alaskan today, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and it would be easier to explain this </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">if I had a picture to show you, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but I was with our young dog </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and he was running through the tall grass </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like running through the tall grass </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is all of life together, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">until a bird calls or he finds a beer can </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and that thing fills all the space in his head. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">You see, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his mind can only hold one thought at a time </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and when he finally hears me call his name </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">he looks up and cocks his head. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For a single moment </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">my voice is everything: </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Self-portrait at 28. </span></p>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 75, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
