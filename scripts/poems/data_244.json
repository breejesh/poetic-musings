Nay, the little things\nOf daily life it is which mold, and shape,\nAnd make him apt for noble deeds and true.\nAnd as we read some much-loved masterpiece,\nRead it as long ago the author read,\nWith eyes that brimmed with tears as he saw\nThe message he believed in stamped in type\nInviolable for the slow-coming years;\nWe know a certain subtle sympathy,\nWe seem to clasp his hand across the past,\nHis words become related to the time,\nHe is at one with his own glorious creed\nAnd all that in his world was dared and done.\nThe long, still, fruitful hours slip away\nShedding their influences as they pass;\nWe know ourselves the richer to have sat\nUpon this dusty floor and dreamed our dreams.\nNo other place to us were quite the same,\nNo other dreams so potent in their charm,\nFor this is ours! Every twist and turn\nOf every narrow stair is known and loved;\nEach nook and cranny is our very own;\nThe dear, old, sleepy place is full of spells\nFor us, by right of long inheritance.\nThe building simply bodies forth a thought\nPeculiarly inherent to the race.\nAnd we, descendants of that elder time,\nHave learnt to love the very form in which\nThe thought has been embodied to our years.\nAnd here we feel that we are not alone,\nWe too are one with our own richest past;\nAnd here that veiled, but ever smouldering fire\nOf race, which rarely seen yet never dies,\nSprings up afresh and warms us with its heat.\nAnd must they take away this treasure house,\nTo us so full of thoughts and memories;\nTo all the world beside a dismal place\nLacking in all this modern age requires\nTo tempt along the unfamiliar paths\nAnd leafy lanes of old time literatures?\nIt takes some time for moss and vines to grow\nAnd warmly cover gaunt and chill stone walls\nOf stately buildings from the cold North Wind.\nThe lichen of affection takes as long,\nOr longer, ere it lovingly enfolds\nA place which since without it were bereft,\nAll stript and bare, shorn of its chiefest grace.\nFor what to us were halls and corridors\nHowever large and fitting, if we part\nWith this which is our birthright; if we lose\nA sentiment profound, unsoundable,\nWhich Time's slow ripening alone can make,\nAnd man's blind foolishness so quickly mar.\n "}, {"title": "Sea Shell", "view_node": "/poem/sea-shell", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/amy-lowell\" hreflang=\"und\">Amy Lowell</a>", "field_date_published": "2018", "body": " <pre>\n          Sea Shell, Sea Shell,\n           Sing me a song, O Please!\n          A song of ships, and sailor men,\n           And parrots, and tropical trees,\n\n          Of islands lost in the Spanish Main\n          Which no man ever may find again,\n          Of fishes and corals under the waves,\n          And seahorses stabled in great green caves.\n\n          Sea Shell, Sea Shell,\n          Sing of the things you know so well.\n</pre> "}, {"title": "Fringed Gentians", "view_node": "/poem/fringed-gentians", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/amy-lowell\" hreflang=\"und\">Amy Lowell</a>", "field_date_published": "2018", "body": " <pre>\n          Near where I live there is a lake\n          As blue as blue can be, winds make\n          It dance as they go blowing by.\n          I think it curtseys to the sky.\n\n          It's just a lake of lovely flowers\n          And my Mamma says they are ours;\n          But they are not like those we grow\n          To be our very own, you know.\n\n          We have a splendid garden, there\n          Are lots of flowers everywhere;\n          Roses, and pinks, and four o'clocks\n          And hollyhocks, and evening stocks.\n\n          Mamma lets us pick them, but never\n          Must we pick any gentians \u2014 ever!\n          For if we carried them away\n          They'd die of homesickness that day.\n</pre> "}, {"title": "The Painted Ceiling", "view_node": "/poem/painted-ceiling", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/amy-lowell\" hreflang=\"und\">Amy Lowell</a>", "field_date_published": "2018", "body": " <pre>\n          My Grandpapa lives in a wonderful house\n           With a great many windows and doors,\n          There are stairs that go up, and stairs that go down,\n           And such beautiful, slippery floors.\n\n          But of all of the rooms, even mother's and mine,\n           And the bookroom, and parlour and all,\n          I like the green dining-room so much the best\n           Because of its ceiling and wall.\n\n          Right over your head is a funny round hole\n           With apples and pears falling through;\n          There's a big bunch of grapes all purply and sweet,\n           And melons and pineapples too.\n\n          They tumble and tumble, but never come down\n           Though I've stood underneath a long while\n          With my mouth open wide, for I always have hoped\n           Just a cherry would drop from the pile.\n\n          No matter how early I run there to look\n           It has always begun to fall through;\n          And one night when at bedtime I crept in to see,\n           It was falling by candle-light too.\n\n          I am sure they are magical fruits, and each one\n           Makes you hear things, or see things, or go\n          Forever invisible;
