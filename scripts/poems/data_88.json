I was overweight and swimming in my body. There were other</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">children in the neighborhood I spent time with each day. We would go in a pack to</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the corner store to buy candy. My favorites were a goop I squeezed from a tube and</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pastel yellow and blue droplets in a grid on wax. I missed my father. I ate wax in my</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">impatience. We smashed dry ramen noodles with our hands while the bag was still</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">closed. We were sealed with the moment. Not looking down from above, not some</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">feet out ahead but flush with perception. In each music, a trace. My uncle owned a</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">photography shop near Les Cayes, where he developed film and made shirts and mugs</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with people\u2019s faces on them. When he shot himself, no one explained why someone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">might do that. Where does anyone get their inspiration?

Something</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">around the corner. The changeable velocities of thought break barrier. I will not run</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">until it\u2019s time. My uncle\u2019s mother, the day he died, had heard of his male lover. My</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">uncle and his wife had just married. They\u2019d conceived a child. My uncle transferred</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his remaining funds into his eldest son\u2019s bank account. The present moment can be</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">your mother, whether or not your mother was trying to hurt you. In Malden, on the</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">hood of Bob\u2019s car out in front of the house, the phenomenon of clouds moved me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Decades later, in front of a mirror, I see my body for the first time.

We looked around the library lined with books and thought of other libraries we had sat in lined with books and then of all the libraries we would never sit in lined with books, some of which contained scenes set in libraries.\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0We felt nostalgic for post offices, even though we were standing in a post office. We studied the rows of stamps under glass and thought about how their tiny castles, poets, cars, and flowers would soon be sent off to all cardinal points. We rarely got paper letters anymore, so our visits to the post office were formal, pro forma.\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0We felt nostalgic for city parks, even though we were walking through a city park, in a city full of city parks in a country full of cities full of city parks, with their green benches, bedraggled bushes, and shabby pansies, cut into the city. (Were the city parks bits of nature showing through cutouts in the concrete, or was the concrete showing through cutouts in nature?)\u00a0 \u00a0*\u00a0 \u00a0We sat in a caf\u00e9 drinking too much coffee and checking our feeds, wondering why we were more anxious about the future than anxiously awaiting it. Was the future showing through cutouts in the present, or were bits of the present showing through cutouts in a future we already found ourselves in, arrived in our caf\u00e9 chairs like fizzled jetpacks? The caf\u00e9 was in a former apothecary lined with dark wood shelves and glowing white porcelain jars labeled in gilded Latin, which for many years had sat empty. Had a person with an illness coming to fetch her weekly dose of meds from one of the jars once said to the city surrounding the shop, which was no longer this city, Stay, thou art so fair? Weren\u2019t these the words that had sealed the bargainer\u2019s doom? Sitting in our presumptive futures, must we let everything run through our hands\u2014which were engineered to grab\u2014into the past? In the library, in the post office, in the city park, in the caf\u00e9, in the apothecary... o give us the medicine, even if it is a pharmakon\u2014which, as the pharmacist knows, either poisons or heals\u2014just like nostalgia. Just like the ruins of nostalgia.</p>\n"}, {"title": "Villanelle ", "view_node": "/poem/villanelle-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/otto-leland-bohanan\" hreflang=\"en\">Otto Leland Bohanan</a>", "field_date_published": "1915", "body": "<p>How dreary the winds shriek and whine:<br />\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The trembling shadows grow chill.\u00a0<br />\nO soul of my soul, wert thou mine!</p>\n<p>O where are the stars that did shine?<br />\n\u00a0 \u00a0 The moonlight that tinselled the hill?<br />\nHow dreary the winds shriek and whine!\u00a0</p>\n<p>Despair \u2019round my heart doth entwine,<br />\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Far soundeth my cry weird and shrill:<br />\nO soul of my soul, wert thou mine!</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve quaffed to the dregs the mad wine\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of passion, but under my sill<br />\nHow dreary the winds shriek and whine!</p>\n<p>\u2019Tis thine, is the dream so divine,\u00a0<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That doth this vain yearning instill;\u00a0<br />\nO soul of my soul, wert thou mine!</p>\n<p>\u2019Tis mine, here to crave and to pine<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For what thou wilt never fulfill;<br />\nHow dreary the winds shriek and whine!<br />\nO soul of my soul, wert thou mine!\u00a0</p>\n"}, {"title": "To God our twice-Revenger", "view_node": "/poem/god-our-twice-revenger", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/john-wilson\" hreflang=\"en\">John Wilson</a>", "field_date_published": "", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">We saw, but oh!
