He appeared\nat noon, asking for water. He\u2019d walked from town\nafter losing his job, leaving me a note for his wife and his brother\nand locking his dog in the coal bunker.\nWe made him a bed\n\nand he slept till Monday.\nA week went by and he hung up his coat.\nThen a month, and not a stroke of work, a word of thanks,\na farthing of rent or a sign of him leaving.\nOne evening he mentioned a recipe\n\nfor smooth, seedless gooseberry sorbet\nbut by then I was tired of him: taking pocket money\nfrom my boy at cards, sucking up to my wife and on his last night\nsizing up my daughter. He was smoking my pipe\nas we stirred his supper.\n\nWhere does the hand become the wrist?\nWhere does the neck become the shoulder? The watershed\nand then the weight, whatever turns up and tips us over that\n   razor\u2019s edge\nbetween something and nothing, between \none and the other. \n\nI could have told him this\nbut didn't bother. We ran him a bath\nand held him under, dried him off and dressed him\nand loaded him into the back of the pick-up.\nThen we drove without headlights\n\nto the county boundary,\ndropped the tailgate, and after my boy\nhad been through his pockets we dragged him like a mattress\nacross the meadow and on the count of four\nthrew him over the border.\n\nThis is not general knowledge, except\nin gooseberry season, which reminds me, and at the table\nI have been known to raise an eyebrow, or scoop the sorbet\ninto five equal portions, for the hell of it.\nI mention this for a good reason.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Pigeons at Dawn", "view_node": "/poem/pigeons-dawn", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/charles-simic\" hreflang=\"und\">Charles Simic</a>", "field_date_published": "2005", "body": " <pre>\nExtraordinary efforts are being made\nTo hide things from us, my friend.\nSome stay up into the wee hours\nTo search their souls. \nOthers undress each other in darkened rooms.\n\nThe creaky old elevator\nTook us down to the icy cellar first\nTo show us a mop and a bucket\nBefore it deigned to ascend again\nWith a sigh of exasperation.\n\nUnder the vast, early-dawn sky\nThe city lay silent before us.\nEverything on hold:\nRooftops and water towers,\nClouds and wisps of white smoke.\n\nWe must be patient, we told ourselves,\nSee if the pigeons will coo now\nFor the one who comes to her window\nTo feed them angel cake,\nAll but invisible, but for her slender arm.</pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 603, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
