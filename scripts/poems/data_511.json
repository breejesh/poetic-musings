It is now restoring to its shapely body its own secret light, a color of faintly cloudy green and pearl.</p>\n\n<p>Directly in front of my bench, perhaps thirty yards away from me, there is a startling woman. Her hair is black as the inmost secret of light in a perfectly cut diamond, a perilous black, a secret light that must have been studied for many years before the anxious and disciplined craftsman could achieve the necessary balance between courage and skill to stroke the strange stone and take the one chance he would ever have to bring that secret to light.</p>\n\n<p>While I was trying to compose the preceding sentence, the woman rose from her park bench and walked away. I am afraid her secret might never come to light in my lifetime. But my lifetime is not the only one. I will never see her again. I hope she brings some other man's secret face to light, as somebody brought mine. I am startled to discover that I am not afraid. I am free to give a blessing out of my silence into that woman's black hair. I trust her to go on living. I believe in her black hair, her diamond that is still asleep. I would close my eyes to daydream about her. But those silent companions who watch over me from the insides of my eyelids are too brilliant for me to meet face to face.</p>\n\n<p>The very emptiness of the park bench in front of mine is what makes me happy. Somewhere else in Verona at just this moment, a woman is sitting or walking or standing still upright. Surely two careful and accurate hands, total strangers to me, measure the invisible idea of the secret vein in her hair. They are waiting patiently until they know what they alone can ever know: that time when her life will pause in mid-flight for a split second. The hands will touch her black hair very gently. A wind off the river Adige will flutter past her. She will turn around, smile a welcome, and place a flawless and fully formed Italian daybreak into the hands.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have any idea what his face will look like. The light still hidden inside his body is no business of mine. I am happy enough to sit in this park alone now. I turn my own face toward the river Adige. A little wind flutters off the water and brushes past me and returns.</p>\n\n<p>It is all right with me to know that my life is only one life. I feel like the light of the river Adige.</p>\n\n<p>By this time, we are both an open secret.</p>\n\n<pre>\n                                                                                                       <i>Verona</i></pre>\n"}, {"title": "The Yoke", "view_node": "/poem/yoke", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/frank-bidart\" hreflang=\"und\">Frank Bidart</a>", "field_date_published": "1997", "body": " <pre>\n<i>don't worry     I know you're dead\nbut tonight\n\nturn your face again\ntoward me\n\nwhen I hear your voice there is now\nno direction in which to turn</i>\n\nI sleep and wake and sleep and wake and sleep and wake and\n\nbut tonight\nturn your face again\n\ntoward me\n\n<i>see     upon my shoulders is the yoke\nthat is not a yoke</i>\n\ndon't worry          I know you're dead\nbut tonight\n\nturn your face again</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Branches", "view_node": "/poem/branches", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jean-valentine\" hreflang=\"und\">Jean Valentine</a>", "field_date_published": "2009", "body": " <pre>\nThe branches looked first like tepees,\nbut there was no emptiness.\n\nLike piles of leaves waiting for fire:\nat the foot of the wisewoman trees,\nat the foot of the broken General,\n\nnext to the tree of the veteran\ngirl who died this summer       slow red\ncloth</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Red Cloth", "view_node": "/poem/red-cloth", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jean-valentine\" hreflang=\"und\">Jean Valentine</a>", "field_date_published": "2009", "body": " <pre>\nRed cloth\nI lie on the ground\notherwise nothing could hold\n\nI put my hand on the ground\nthe membrane is gone\nand nothing does hold\n\nyour place in the ground\nis all of it\nand it is breathing</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Noisetone", "view_node": "/poem/noisetone", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/barbara-guest\" hreflang=\"und\">Barbara Guest</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <pre>\n     Each artist embarks on a personal search.\n         An artist may take introspective refreshment from green.\n\nOr so they say in Barcelona when air is dry.\n     In our country it is a water sprinkler that hints, \"rinsed green.\"\n              Colors often break themselves into separate hues\n\n     of noisetone.

When the flamingo\nFlew into a meeting of the Board of Estimate,\nThe new mayor acted at once and called the photographers.\nWhen the first green creeper crawled upon Brooklyn Bridge,\nThey thought it was ornamental. They let it stay.\n\nThat was the year the termites came to New York\nAnd they don't do well in cold climates\u2014but listen, Joe,\nThey're only ants, and ants are nothing but insects.\nIt was funny and yet rather wistful, in a way\n(As Heywood Broun pointed out in the <i>World-Telegram</i>)\nTo think of them looking for wood in a steel city.\nIt made you feel about life. It was too divine.\nThere were funny pictures by all the smart, funny artists\nAnd Macy's ran a terribly clever ad:\n\"The Widow's Termite\" or something.\n                                                      There was no\nDisturbance.

It was too hot,\nToo hot to protest, too hot to get excited,\nAn even African heat, lush, fertile and steamy,\nThat soaked into bone and mind and never once broke.\nThe warm rain fell in fierce showers and ceased and fell.\nPretty soon you got used to its always being that way.\n\nYou got used to the changed rhythm, the altered beat,\nTo people walking slower, to the whole bright\nFierce pulse of the city slowing, to men in shorts,\nTo the new sun-helmets from Best's and the cop's white uniforms,\nAnd the long noon-rest in the offices, everywhere.\nIt wasn't a plan or anything. It just happened.\nThe fingers tapped slower, the office-boys\nDozed on their benches, the bookkeeper yawned at his desk.\nThe A. T. &amp; T. was the first to change the shifts\nAnd establish an official siesta-room;\nBut they were always efficient. Mostly it just\nHappened like sleep itself, like a tropic sleep,\nTill even the Thirties were deserted at noon\nExcept for a few tourists and one damp cop.\nThey ran boats to see the big lilies on the North River\nBut it was only the tourists who really noticed\nThe flocks of rose-and-green parrots and parakeets\nNesting in the stone crannies of the Cathedral.\nThe rest of us had forgotten when they first came.\n\nThere wasn't any real change, it was just a heat spell,\nA rain spell, a funny summer, a weather-man's joke,\nIn spite of the geraniums three feet high\nIn the tin-can gardens of Hester and Desbrosses.\nNew York was New York. It couldn't turn inside out.\nWhen they got the news from Woods Hole about the Gulf Stream,\nThe Times ran a adequate story.\nBut nobody reads those stories but science-cranks.\n\nUntil, one day, a somnolent city-editor\nGave a new cub the termite yarn to break his teeth on.\nThe cub was just down from Vermont, so he took his time.\nHe was serious about it. He went around.\nHe read all about termites in the Public Library\nAnd it made him sore when they fired him.\n                                                             So, one evening,\nTalking with an old watchman, beside the first\nRaw girders of the new Planetopolis Building\n(Ten thousand brine-cooled offices, each with shower)\nHe saw a dark line creeping across the rubble\nAnd turned a flashlight on it.\n                                        \"Say, buddy,\" he said,\n\"You'd better look out for those ants.

tradition of Wingate Hall.\nOne was Cudjo and one was you\nAnd the third was the mistress, Mary Lou.\nMary Lou Wingate, as slightly made\nAnd as hard to break as a rapier-blade.\nBristol's daughter and Wingate's bride,\nNever well since the last child died\nBut staring at pain with courteous eyes.\nWhen the pain outwits it, the body dies,\nMeanwhile the body bears the pain.\nShe loved her hands and they made her vain,\nThe tiny hands of her generation\nThat gathered the reins of the whole plantation;\nThe velvet sheathing the steel demurely\nIn the trained, light grip that holds so surely.\n\nShe was at work by candlelight,\nShe was at work in the dead of night,\nSmoothing out troubles and healing schisms\nAnd doctoring phthisics and rheumatisms,\nGuiding the cooking and watching the baking,\nThe sewing, the soap-and-candle-making,\nThe brewing, the darning, the lady-daughters,\nThe births and deaths in the negro-quarters,\nSeeing that Suke had some new, strong shoes\nAnd Joe got a week in the calaboose,\nWhile Dicey's Jacob escaped a whipping\nAnd the jellybag dripped with its proper dripping,\nAnd the shirts and estrangements were neatly mended,\nAnd all of the tasks that never ended.\n\nHer manner was gracious but hardly fervent\nAnd she seldom raised her voice to a servant.\nShe was often mistaken, not often blind,\nAnd she knew the whole duty of womankind,\nTo take the burden and have the power\nAnd seem like the well-protected flower,\nTo manage a dozen industries\nWith a casual gesture in scraps of ease,\nTo hate the sin and to love the sinner\nAnd to see that the gentlemen got their dinner\nReady and plenty and piping-hot\nWhether you wanted to eat or not.\nAnd always, always, to have the charm\nThat makes the gentlemen take your arm\nBut never the bright, unseemly spell\nThat makes strange gentlemen love too well,\nOnce you were married and settled down\nWith a suitable gentleman of your own.\n\nAnd when that happened, and you had bred\nThe requisite children, living and dead,\nTo pity the fool and comfort the weak\nAnd always let the gentlemen speak,\nTo succor your love from deep-struck roots\nWhen gentlemen went to bed in their boots,\nAnd manage a gentleman's whole plantation\nIn the manner befitting your female station.\n\nThis was the creed that her mother taught her\nAnd the creed that she taught to every daughter.\nShe knew her Bible\u2014and how to flirt\nWith a swansdown fan and a brocade skirt.\nFor she trusted in God but she liked formalities\nAnd the world and Heaven were both realities.\n\u2014In Heaven, of course, we should all be equal,\nBut, until we came to that golden sequel,\nGentility must keep to gentility\nWhere God and breeding had made things stable,\nWhile the rest of the cosmos deserved civility\nBut dined in its boots at the second-table.\n\nThis view may be reckoned a trifle narrow,\nBut it had the driving force of an arrow,\nAnd it helped Mary Lou to stand up straight,\nFor she was gentle, but she could hate\nAnd she hated the North with the hate of Jael\nWhen the dry hot hands went seeking the nail,\nThe terrible hate of women's ire,\nThe smoky, the long-consuming fire.\nThe Yankees were devils, and she could pray,\nFor devils, no doubt, upon Judgment Day,\nBut now in the world, she would hate them still\nAnd send the gentlemen out to kill.\n\nThe gentlemen killed and the gentlemen died,\nBut she was the South's incarnate pride\nThat mended the broken gentlemen\nAnd sent them out to the war again,\nThat kept the house with the men away\nAnd baked the bricks where there was no clay,\nMade courage from terror and bread from bran\nAnd propped the South on a swansdown fan\nThrough four long years of ruin and stress,\nThe pride\u2014and the deadly bitterness.\n\nLet us look at her now, let us see her plain,\nShe will never be quite like this again.\nHer house is rocking under the blast\nAnd she hears it tremble, and still stands fast,\nBut this is the last, this is the last.\nThe last of the wine and the white corn meal,\nThe last high fiddle singing the reel,\nThe last of the silk with the Paris label,\nThe last blood-thoroughbred safe in the stable\n\u2014Yellow corn meal and a jackass colt,\nA door that swings on a broken bolt,\nBrittle old letters spotted with tears\nAnd a wound that rankles for fifty years\u2014\nThis is the last of Wingate Hall,\nThe last bright August before the Fall,\nDeath has been near, and Death has passed,\nBut this is the last, this is the last.\nThere will be hope, and a scratching pen,\nThere will be cooking for tired men,\nThe waiting for news with shut, hard fists,\nAnd the blurred, strange names in the battle-lists,\nThe April sun and the April rain,\nBut never this day come back again.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "A Bird came down the Walk (328)", "view_node": "/poem/bird-came-down-walk-328", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/emily-dickinson\"

More About the Dead Man and Your Hands\n\nNights, he lets in the world, the dead man does it, always.\nBy any late night, he has lost the need to believe.\nThe dead man plays a nighttime piano, he blows a nighttime horn, he sings more after midnight. \nDead man's music is nighttime, call it earthly, call it planetary.\nThe dead man feels the high registers heard by animal ears.\nHe feels the rumbly pedal note struck by redwoods enlarging and tectonic plates lurching.\nWhat is it about his hands and your hands, is it the absence of certainty?\nHe has stirred distinctions into a broth, a soup, a stew, a gravy.\nYou cannot find yes and no, true or false, in a dead man's soup.\nSo what if they have caught on, the dead man is out front and stays up later.\nHence, when the dead man maketh eyes, he's gotcha.\nHe'll care for you, now that he's gotcha, and he hath giveth his hand.\nHe can't talk about the children if you are going to cry.\n\n\n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Mint", "view_node": "/poem/mint", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/elaine-terranova\" hreflang=\"und\">Elaine Terranova</a>", "field_date_published": "2006", "body": " <pre>\nAlready, we'd be driving past\nthose trees, that part of the forest.\nEven briefly, it refreshed you.\nIt was like mint in August\nthough that sting would be gone\nwith summer.
