\n      Remotest realms admiring stand, \n      And hail the <i>Hero</i> of our land: \n\nHe comes!\u2014the Genius of these lands\u2014 \n   Fame's thousand tongues his worth confess, \nWho conquered with his suffering bands, \n   And grew immortal by distress: \n      Thus calms succeed the stormy blast, \n      And valour is repaid at last. \n\nO Washington!\u2014thrice glorious name, \n   What due rewards can man decree\u2014 \nEmpires are far below thy aim, \n   And sceptres have no charms for thee; \n      <i>Virtue</i> alone has thy regard, \n      And she must be thy great reward. \n\nEncircled by extorted power, \n   <i>Monarchs</i> must envy thy Retreat, \n<i>Who</i> cast, in some ill fated hour, \n   Their country's freedom at their feet; \n      'Twas thine to act a nobler part \n      For injur'd Freedom had thy heart. \n\nFor ravag'd realms and conquer'd seas \n   Borne gave the great imperial prize, \nAnd, swelTd with pride, for feats like these, \n   Transferr'd her heroes to the skies:\u2014 \n      A brighter scene your deeds display, \n      You gain those heights a different way. \n\nWhen <i>Faction</i> rear'd her bristly head, \n   And join'd with tyrants to destroy, \nWhere'er you march' d the monster fled, \n   Tim'rous her arrows to employ; \n      Hosts catch'd from you a bolder flame, \n      And despots trembled at your name. \n\nEre war's dread horrors ceas'd to reign, \n   What leader could your place supply?\u2014 \nChiefs crowded to the embattled plain, \n   Prepaid to conquer or to die\u2014 \n      Heroes arose\u2014 but none like yon \n      Could save our lives and freedom too. \n\nIn swelling verse let kings be read, \n   And princes shine in polish'd prose;

\n      Time's latest age shall own in you \n      The patriot and the statesman too. \n\nNow hurrying from the busy scene, \n   Where thy <i>Potowmack's</i> waters flow, \nMayt thou enjoy thy rural reign, \n   And every earthly blessing know; \n      Thus He* whom Rome's proud legions sway'd, \n      Beturn'd, and sought his sylvan shade. \n\nNot less in wisdom than in war \n   <i>Freedom</i> shall still employ your mind, \n<i>Slavery</i> shall vanish, wide and far, \n   'Till not a trace is left behind; \n      Your counsels not bestow'd in vain \n      Shall still protect this infant reign, \n\nSo when the bright, all-cheering sun \n   From our contracted view retires, \nThough fools may think his race is run, \n   On other worlds he lights his fires: \n      Cold climes beneath his influence glow, \n      And frozen rivers learn to flow. \n\nO say, thou great, exalted name! \n   What Muse can boast of equal lays, \nThy worth disdains all vulgar fame, \n   Transcends the noblest poet's praise, \n      Art soars, unequal to the flight, \n      And genius sickens at the height. \n\nFor States redeem'd\u2014 our western reign \n   Restored by thee to milder sway, \nThy conscious glory shall remain \n   When this great globe is swept away, \n      And <i>all</i> is lost that pride admires, \n      And all the pageant scene expires.\n\n\n<i>* Cincinnatus</i></pre>\n "}, {"title": "Soliloquy, Act 6 [excerpt]", "view_node": "/poem/soliloquy-act-6-excerpt", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/kenneth-goldsmith\" hreflang=\"und\">Kenneth Goldsmith</a>", "field_date_published": "2001", "body": " <p>No. I'm not mad.

You don't know where that bag went? All right. We'll just use a regular bag. We'll just go buy another. I'm gonna drop you downstairs and you're gonna be living there for a whole week. Oh, look at the sweet one. Do you have a shoehorn? A what? What's a shoehorn? What? What's a shoehorn? Huh? So I like my mother's stories about Max throwing tantrums. That was funny. Hey, maybe we can go, oh, you know what we should do when we're out on the Island today? After the festivities are winding down? Take my parent's car and try to find some yard sales. I mean it's a beautiful like the first nice spring weekend there's gonna be a million yard tag sales going on in Port Washington. What do you say? What do you say? Yeah. We have to make a 10:20 train, yeah. Aren't they nice? I think they're very hip, don't you? They're sort of square?

Now, um...that's about as far as I can take it. I don't know of anything else. Uh, your foot came toward mine, mine came toward yours. Was that natural? I don't know. Did we bump? Yes.

So let's start from the beginning. You're in the bathroom.</p><p>I went to the bathroom.</p><p>Then what did you do when you went in?</p><p>I stood beside the wall waiting for a stall to open. I got in the stall, sat down, and I started to go to the bathroom. Uh, did our feet come together? Apparently they did bump. Well, I don't dispute that.</p><p>OK, when I got out of the stall I know that...I noticed that other stalls were open. Was there any...</p><p>They were at the time. At the time I entered I I...At the time I entered I stood and waited.</p><p>OK.</p><p>They they were all busy, you know?</p><p>Were you looking at me while you were waiting? I could see your eyes. I could see you plant your fingers and look up.</p><p>Did I glance at your stall? I was glancing at a stall right beside yours waiting for a fellow to empty it.I saw him stand up. And therefore I thought it was gonna empty.</p><p>How long do you think you stood in front of that stall?</p><p>Oh, a minute or two at the most.</p><p>OK. When you went in the stall, then what?</p><p>I sat down.</p><p>Did you do anything with your feet?</p><p>Positioned them? I don't know. I don't know, at the time. I'm a fairly wide guy. I...</p><p>I understand.</p><p>I tend to spread my legs...</p><p>OK.</p><p>...when I lower my pants so they won't slide. OK? Did I slide them too close to yours? Did I...? I looked down once your foot was close to mine.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Did we bump? Uh, you said so. I don't recall that but apparently we were close.</p><p>Yeah. Well, your foot did touch mine on my side of the stall.</p><p>Alright.</p><p>OK. And, then with the hand, um, how many times did you put your hand under the stall?</p><p>I I don't recall. I I remember reaching down once. There was a piece of toilet paper back behind me and I recall picking it up.</p><p>OK. Was your was your pa...palm down or up when you were doing that?</p><p>I don't recall.</p><p>OK. I recall your palm being up. OK?</p><p>Alright.</p><p>Let me pick a piece of paper up. Your palm would be down when you pick something up.</p><p>Yeah, it probably would be. I recall picking the paper up.</p><p>And I know it's hard to describe here on on tape but actually what I saw was your fingers come underneath the stall, so you're actually ta...touching the bottom of the stall.</p><p>I don't...I don't recall that. I don't believe I did that. I don't...I don't do those things.</p><p>I saw I saw your left hand and I could see...I could see the the gold wedding ring when when it went across. I could see that. You know I can. I can see...</p><p>Wait a moment. My left hand was over here...</p><p>I saw...there's a...</p><p>...and my right hand was next to you.</p><p>I could tell it was my, uh, I could tell it was your left hand because your thumb was positioned in a, uh, face-forward in a certain motion. Your thumb was on this side, not on this side.</p><p>Well, we could dispute that. I'm not going to fight you in court but I I reached down with my right hand to pick up the paper.</p><p>I'm telling you that I see that so I know it's your left hand. Also I could see a gold ring on this finger so it's obvious that it was the left hand.</p><p>Yeah, OK. My left hand was in the direct opposite of the stall from you.</p><p>OK.</p><p>You you travel through here frequently, sir?</p><p>I do, um, almost weekly.</p><p>Maybe you've been successful in these bathrooms before?</p><p>I go to that bathroom regularly.</p><p>Do you partake in any of other activity?</p><p>No, Absolutely not. I don't seek activity in bathrooms.</p><p>It's embarrassing.</p><p>Well it's embarrassing for both of us. I'm not going to fight you.</p><p>I know you're not going to fight me, but that's not the point. I would respect you and I still respect you, I don't disrespect you but I'm disrespected right now and I'm not trying to act like I have all kinds of power or anything but you're sitting here lying to a police officer!</p><p>Uh uh, well...I I I don't want...</p><p>It's not a judgment that came from somebody else! I'm being serious to this, OK? I'm trained for this and I know what I'm doing! And I saw you put your hand under there and you're gonna sit there...admit it!</p><p>I I put my hand down.</p><p>You put your hand and rubbed it on the bottom of the stall with your left hand...</p><p>But wait a moment!</p><p>...and I I'm not dumb. I can tell...</p><p>If I if I had turned sideways...that was the only way I could get my left hand over there.</p><p>Not that hard for me to reach all...from my hand to that. It's not that hard. It does happen every day up here now. OK?</p><p>Alright.</p><p>I'm just I'm just...I guess I'm just...I want to say I'm disappointed in you, mister. I just really am. I expected from the guy we get out of the hood that you...I mean, people vote for you!</p><p>Yes. They do and...</p><p>Unbelievable. Unbelievable!</p><p>I'm a respectable kind of person and I don't do these kind of...</p><p>Where's your respect right now, though?</p><p>But I didn't use my left hand. I reached down with my right hand like this just to pick up a piece of paper.</p><p>Was your gold ring on your right hand at any time today?</p><p>Of course not. Try to get it off. Look at it.</p><p>OK, then it was your left hand. I saw it with my own...</p><p>Alright. You saw something that didn't happen.</p><p>Embarrassing. Embarrassing. Alright. This is embarrassing!
