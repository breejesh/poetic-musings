Pale beneath the blaze\nHung the transparent foliage; and I watch'd\nSome broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see\nThe shadow of the leaf and stem above\nDappling its sunshine! And that walnut-tree\nWas richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay\nFull on the ancient ivy, which usurps\nThose fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass\nMakes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue\nThrough the late twilight: and though now the bat\nWheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters,\nYet still the solitary humble-bee\nSings in the bean-flower! Henceforth I shall know\nThat Nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure;\nNo plot so narrow, be but Nature there,\nNo waste so vacant, but may well employ\nEach faculty of sense, and keep the heart\nAwake to Love and Beauty! and sometimes\n'Tis well to be bereft of promis'd good,\nThat we may lift the soul, and contemplate\nWith lively joy the joys we cannot share.\nMy gentle-hearted Charles! when the last rook\nBeat its straight path across the dusky air\nHomewards, I blest it! deeming its black wing\n(Now a dim speck, now vanishing in light)\nHad cross'd the mighty Orb's dilated glory,\nWhile thou stood'st gazing; or, when all was still,\nFlew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm\nFor thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom\nNo sound is dissonant which tells of Life.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Skin&#039;s Broken Aria", "view_node": "/poem/skins-broken-aria", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jennifer-chang\" hreflang=\"und\">Jennifer Chang</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>\nI cross the street\nand my skin falls off.

New York is Egyptian,\nespecially from the little rise on the hill\n\nat 14-C; it has twelve entrances\nlike the body of Jesus, and Easton, where I lived,\nhas two small floating bridges in front of it\nthat brought me in and out. I said good-bye\n\nto them both when I was 57. I'm reading\nJoseph Wood Krutch again\u2014the second time.\nI love how he lived in the desert. I'm looking at the skull \nof Georgia O'Keeffe. I'm kissing Stieglitz good-bye.\n\nHe was a city, Stieglitz was truly a city\nin every sense of the word; he wore a library\nacross his chest; he had a church on his knees.\nI'm kissing him good-bye; he was, for me,\n\nthe last true city; after him there were\nonly overpasses and shopping centers,\nlittle enclaves here and there, a skyscraper\nwith nothing near it, maybe a meaningless turf\n\nwhere whores couldn't even walk, where nobody sits,\nwhere nobody either lies or runs; either that\nor some pure desert: a lizard under a boojum,\na flower sucking the water out of a rock.\n\nWhat is the life of sadness worth, the bookstores\nlost, the drugstores buried, a man with a stick\nturning the bricks up, numbering the shards,\ndream twenty-one, dream twenty-two. I left\n\nwith a glass of tears, a little artistic vial.\nI put it in my leather pockets next\nto my flask of Scotch, my golden knife and my keys,\nmy joyful poems and my T-shirts. Stieglitz is there\n\nbeside his famous number; there is smoke\nand fire above his head; some bowlegged painter\nis whispering in his ear; some lady-in-waiting\nis taking down his words. I'm kissing Stieglitz\n\ngoodbye, my arms are wrapped around him, his photos\nare making me cry; we're walking down Fifth Avenue;\nwe're looking for a pencil; there is a girl\nstanding against the wall\u2014I'm shaking now\n\nwhen I think of her; there are two buildings, one\nis in blackness, there is a dying poplar;\nthere is a light on the meadow; there is a man\non a sagging porch. I would have believed in everything.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Musical Instrument", "view_node": "/poem/musical-instrument-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/luis-cernuda\" hreflang=\"und\">Luis Cernuda</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>If the Arab musician\nPlucks the lute strings\nWith an eagle quill\nTo awaken the notes,\n\nWhat hand plucks \nWith what bird's quill\nThe wound in you\nThat awakens the word?</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Once More, with Feeling", "view_node": "/poem/once-more-feeling", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/luis-cernuda\" hreflang=\"und\">Luis Cernuda</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>\nFrom our old friendship \nI never thought I'd ever remember again\nHow a whole tribe, such a strange group \nTo me and maybe no less strange to you, \nAdopted you. \n\n                                  But one of that tribe, \nA professor and, according to him and others\nOver there (which shows how far our land has fallen),\nA poet, called you \"my prince.\" \nAnd I ask myself what you ever did that he \nCould have come to think of you as his prince. \n\nAcademic claptrap?

Rimbaud rejected the hand that Oppressed</span> \nHis life; Verlaine kisses it, accepting his punishment. \nOne drags in his belt the gold he's gained; the other \nWastes it on absinthe and whores. But both \nOutside the law forever, beyond the respectable people \nWhose meaningless work makes them rich and successful. \n\nThen even the black prostitute had the right to insult them; \nToday, as time has passed, as it does in the world, \n<span class=\"long-line\">Their lives on the edge of everything, sodomy, drunkenness, vicious verses, </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">No longer matter, and France makes use of both their names and their works </span>\nFor the greater glory of France and its logical art. \n<span class=\"long-line\">Their acts and their comings and goings are studied, giving the public </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">Intimate tidbits about their lives. No one is shocked now, nor protests.</span>\n \n\"Verlaine? Go on, my friend, a satyr, a regular lech \nWhen it comes to women; a perfectly normal fellow, \n<span class=\"long-line\">Like you and I. Rimbaud? A devout Catholic, as it's been proved.\" </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">And they recite hunks of the \"Drunken Boat\" and the Sonnet to the \"Vowels.\"</span> \nBut of Verlaine they recite nothing, because he's not in vogue \n<span class=\"long-line\">Like the other, of whom they bring out phony texts in fancy editions; </span>\n<span class=\"long-line\">Young poets, in every country, talk about him nonstop in their provinces.</span>\n \nCan the dead hear what the living are saying about them? \nLet's hope not: that endless silence must be a relief \nFor those who lived and died by the word, \nLike Rimbaud and Verlaine. But the silence there is no escape \n<span class=\"long-line\">From this repugnant laudatory farce. There was a time one of them wished </span>\nThat humanity had a single head, so it could be chopped off. \n<span class=\"long-line\">Maybe he was exaggerating: if it were just a cockroach, and be crushed.</span></pre>\n "}], "pager": {"current_page": 502, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
