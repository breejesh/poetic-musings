The Movie could initiate the kiss if The Movie wanted, as it is so much taller, &#13;\nleaning in, no way to demur, you would be too polite anyway, and, as the Roman poets have &#13;\nstressed, there is always something porous in the decorous. So there can be kissing between you &#13;\nand The Movie, and it would be amazing, better the more incoherent The Movie is and the more &#13;\nyou had to pay to see it, though in the movies it is said that prostitutes don't like to kiss as kissing &#13;\nis too personal, though I disagree, as sometimes the human will make a show of locating you &#13;\nwith a kiss, almost to prove to you that you are a real person with a face and that, absolutely, &#13;\nthey know where the face is and the face isn't, and this is how you know, for sure, that both of &#13;\nyou have been paid. But I don't want to make you feel bad here, and I apologize, for you are &#13;\nentirely kissable, as I have watched you through windows and keyholes even though, up to this &#13;\npoint, you do not appear in movies. Often you appear holding a book in your hand and with God &#13;\nknows what playing in your head\u2014I imagine you repeating to yourself, over and again, \"the &#13;\nhorse knows the way, the horse knows the way\"\u2014and remember: even someone as learned in &#13;\nfilm as Jean Luc Godard got it a little wrong. You can kiss The Movie, if The Movie wants to &#13;\nkiss you.
