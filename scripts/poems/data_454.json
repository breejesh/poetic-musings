Foremostly and therefore barely consequently in the highest manner, he followed the sound, running towards the city hall. After all it was hardly war. Yak-9, made in Russia, flew over the plaza of the city hall. Then in the most lowly predictably ethically unsound manner from the point of view of everything that is big and beautiful, the sound of the machine gun. He missed the chance to capture the Yak-9 with his camera. That late afternoon the yet-to-be nation\u2019s newspapers were in print, but no photos of the war appeared in any of them. After all it was hardly war, the hardliest of wars, neverthelessly Yak. And it turns out that one thing is better than another. Hence still going forward, napalm again. Always moving up to Choson Reservoir. Always another hill, for in no circumstance can man be comfortable without art. Why that is so has nothing to do with the big problem\u2014what to do with the orphan kids. And always the poor hungry kids. Now look at this and look at it and look at it. This is what the Republic of Korea is fighting for\u2014miles and miles and miles of order words that are given in our society. Merry Christmas, Joe! Phosphorous and flamethrowers. Fire them up!\u2014burn them!\u2014cook them! Beauty is pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing from the point of view of everything that is big and beautiful in the highest manner possible and why that is so has nothing to do with hills and more hills, rivers and more rivers, and rice paddies and more rice paddies. How cold does it get in Korea?

I know each plant of that marine desert which is violet-hued at times, at others blue, and I also know the principle of each spiral shell. Some of the plants are endowed with human life; these have transparent eyes like jelly, a body like the sow's teats and a multitude of tiny tentacles which are also mouths. Among the perforated shells I have seen some which were pierced more than a thousand times; and through each tiny opening came and went a fleshly foot, by means of which the shell was conveyed about.</p>\n\n<p>After passing Hercules' pillars the ocean that surrounds the world becomes strange and infuriate.</p>\n\n<p>And in its course it creates darksome types of men and wonderful animals. There is a great serpent, with golden beard, which governs its kingdom wisely; and some women of this country have an eye at the extremity of each finger. Others have beaks and crests like birds; otherwise they resemble us. On one isle at which I landed, the inhabitatns carried their heads where our stomachs are located; and when they saluted us they bowed their abdomens. As to cyclops, pigmies and giants I will say naught of them; for their number is too great.</p>\n\n<p>None of these things appeared to partake of the unnatural to me; I felt no terror of them. But one evening we reached Scyllaeum. Our bark touched sand on the Sicilian side. As I was turning the rudder I perceived in the water's midst the head of a woman with closed eyes. Her hair was tinged with gold. She seemed to sleep. And then, indeed, I trembled for I feared to look into her eyes, well knowing that, having once gazed therein, I should turn the rudder of our boat toward the seething whirlpool.</p>\n"}, {"title": "Approach of Winter", "view_node": "/poem/approach-winter", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-carlos-williams\" hreflang=\"und\">William Carlos Williams</a>", "field_date_published": "1921", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">The half-stripped trees</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">struck by a wind together,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">bending all,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the leaves flutter drily</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and refuse to let go</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or driven like hail</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">stream bitterly out to one side</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and fall</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">where the salvias, hard carmine,\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like no leaf that ever was\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">edge the bare garden.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "To the Roaring Wind", "view_node": "/poem/roaring-wind", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/wallace-stevens\" hreflang=\"und\">Wallace Stevens</a>", "field_date_published": "1923", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">What syllable are you seeking,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Vocalissimus,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In the distances of sleep?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speak it.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "An Old Man&#039;s Winter Night", "view_node": "/poem/old-mans-winter-night", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/robert-frost\" hreflang=\"und\">Robert Frost</a>", "field_date_published": "1916", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">All out of doors looked darkly in at him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">What kept him from remembering what it was</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That brought him to that creaking room was age.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He stood with barrels round him\u2014at a loss.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And having scared the cellar under him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In clomping there, he scared it once again</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In clomping off;\u2014and scared the outer night,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of trees and crack of branches, common things,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But nothing so like beating on a box.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A light he was to no one but himself</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A quiet light, and then not even that.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He consigned to the moon,\u2014such as she was,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So late-arising,\u2014to the broken moon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">As better than the sun in any case</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">His icicles along the wall to keep;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And slept.
