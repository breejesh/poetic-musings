once be touched<br />\nthat\u2019s what the poem does<br />\nreaches out w/ its long spindly arms its grandmother arms to hold you\u00a0 \u00a0 but you are the arms also in the act of reaching, enfolding in yourself all the primness and solidarity and creakiness of the grandparent as it holds you thru the reaches of time\u00a0 and you are time itself\u00a0 grandfather time grandparent time\u00a0 the grandiosity of time ticking away in its grandparent clock, the clock that haunted the halls of your grandparents and the further forebears that measure things not by clocks, but by the sun.\u00a0 as the dawn rang out, everything was ok, we\u2014our forebears\u2014noted where the light of the sun first fell on the earth at dawn, <em>bitole</em> the sun\u2019s rays, these were holy holy and where they fell is where we placed our firepit, and around that pit laid four stones, and those stones were the four directions, and from them measured out four tipi poles at equal distance, and between these eight more fanning out, and atop it erected a tipi the home of the holy person, and atop the tipi a crown of evergreens and other plants, <em>yaa da\u2019a\u2019ah</em>, the tops of the poles unshorn of their leaves, blessings were conferred, songs happened in time, to the beat of the deerhoof rattle, not to a beat itself\u00a0 since a rattle\u2019s noise is disparate, spread out, but to the idea or the sense of a beat nestled at the center of the shaking of the rattle and its small collection of sounds, thrill of the pulsatile universe unfolding across time, \u2018across\u2019 as if time were a length of thread, or a thing traversed in space\u00a0 \u00a0 songs, poetry happened across the pulse of time, they were not like a painting making its \u2018same damn face whether the Louvre was open or closed,\u2019 but like music\u00a0 \u00a0 happening in time, so that you couldn\u2019t look at the whole thing all at once, you couldn\u2019t look at its face headon\u00a0 \u00a0 you had to perceive it apace, at a pace \u00a0 \u00a0 it didn\u2019t matter whether time was a thing you believed in or not, whether time was a thing that was real or not, whether it coalesced with space, the space you moved through with your foot on the real earth.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 you spoke to your lover on a thing called \u2018facetime\u2019 because you were far apart in space, hours apart in time, you could not hold each other but you could see each other\u2019s face, you could see the face but not touch it, it was a face as represented by a screen, your faces appeared to each other on this screen\u00a0 and your voices too could be beheld, perceived, in and across time, and across space\u00a0 they could be beheld but not touched, face-to-face you could be, of a kind, but your cheeks could not touch like in the song where the lovers danced cheek-to-cheek, and your lover said they didn\u2019t want to have a relationship through this thing through this \u2018face\u2019 and this \u2018time\u2019 and you agreed.\u00a0 \u00a0 a thing that everafter sterilized your concern into a thing seen but untouchable, like the painting in the museum, which could be looked and looked at only. \u2018touch me only with thine eyes\u2019 some prim poet probably once said.\u00a0 \u2018look but don\u2019t touch\u2019 one of my parents said to the other, speaking of attractive people.\u00a0 that the gaze is said to touch, it is said to do violence.\u00a0 take that sunmote out of your eye when you look at me.\u00a0 take that beam out of your eye.\u00a0 i am a crap.\u00a0 i am a happenstance.\u00a0 i am holy holy.\u00a0 christ\u2019s eyebeams pierced thomas too you know.\u00a0 \u00a0 a woman wore the feather of a flicker on the top of the red blanket she wore around her shoulders in the peyote meetings of the lipan, who kept the beat first by a bow they hit with a stick, a stick not an arrow and then by various drums of water.\u00a0 who tie up a drum in the flick of an eye.\u00a0 \u00a0 a flicker is so called because the undersides of its wings are yellow, you see them in a golden flash flashing across the forest.\u00a0 by you i mean me.\u00a0 my lover once held me creakily in grandparent arms before it became an insect\u00a0 and one calling all of the old ones of the desert to us, even embarrassed about the beat that it made because it was not native, it being the lover, still it was a holy thing, holy holy, <em>d\u00edy\u00edn</em>, <em>d\u00edy\u00ednde</em>, a holy person, singing a double beat, first to the earth and then to me, i am erthes i said, erthes, as two syllables, i felt the pricks the holy pricks of the lauered on the crown of my head and i felt them seeding, i felt them being seeded there, holy holy, there is no god there is only <em>d\u00ed\u00edyi </em>robert said, but what accounts for that thing we saw in the desert.\u00a0 \u00a0 i seed and then i saw it, i seed and saw it,\u00a0 a seesaw is a thing that you see and then you saw, it measures vision across time as the bodily movement of two children going up and going down, sawed in half the measure of my eye, the top of my head took clean off.\u00a0 looking is not the same as touching.\u00a0 there is a frog that looks with bifocular vision, the top half of its eye evolved a skill for looking above water, and the bottom half of its eye for looking below water.\u00a0 when is\u00e1n\u00e1klesh came out of the water she danced on the shore but for a long time she stayed in the water with her face half-submerged.\u00a0 they didn\u2019t know if it was a man or a woman.\u00a0 when she came out of the water the bottom half of her face was stained with the minerals of the primordial pond.\u00a0 the bottom half of her face looked white.\u00a0 now they paint the girl that way with <em>klesh</em>\u00a0 the white clay\u00a0 the earth\u00a0 on the bottom half of her face.\u00a0 but she is is\u00e1n\u00e1klesh now she is not the girl anymore.\u00a0 \u00a0 poetry occurs in time, syllable by syllable.\u00a0 a trance-state occurs peripherally, serially, over and over and in that state you \u2018passed\u2019 time but you didn\u2019t notice the passing of time.\u00a0 you were as it were beyond time,\u00a0 though occurring in time and primarily to the beat of the rattle and the rhythm of the singing.\u00a0 \u00a0 you can touch and be touched in a poem, though it come thru the ear, tho it come through the eye, it touches in the way a person is said to be touched, i\u2019m touched you say when a thing touches you emotionally, and you touch your heart to indicate the heart, to say that that is where you are touched.\u00a0 the heart is understood to be the seat of love.\u00a0 a pulse is measured there, a cardiac pulse whose stoppage or whose arrest is death, the stopping or the stoppage of cardiac time.\u00a0 \u00a0 we saw a snake upon the trail, a smooth green snake undulated into curves, elegant s-like curves upon the moss, hello i said, can i touch you i said, and taking its calm aspect for an acquiescence gently stroked the back of its back \u00a0 and the snake\u00a0 straightened out, and faced its face toward me, i do not know what this means in snake language.\u00a0 perhaps i was touched to touch a snake, touched as in mad, mad as in crazy, feet not on the earth, not on the erthes as the creature itself was, and not its avatar, its whole body upon the earth.\u00a0 \u00a0 time can have a wrinkle in it, \u00a0 and wrinkles\u00a0 can be ironed out.</p>\n"}, {"title": "Les Globes",

</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">but this stopped, in part because of trust </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(he did not believe I was smoking less and resented the imagined lie) </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">in part because of routes </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(at first I added 15 minutes to my commute to walk north, past his apartment, towards 6th avenue, and up through the park, as this removes 25-50% of my anxiety, but now that I have lived here half a year, I find myself incapable of waking up early enough to permit this easy remedy, so I walk the other, faster direction) </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and in part because of novelty </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">(having covered introductions, we now tend to say only \u201chello\u201d when I do pass). </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I have a sense of what he looks like, due to this regularity, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but I could not describe his building. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Someone I was hoping to kiss informed me </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that it\u2019s easy to remember </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">images (all you have to do, they said, is take </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a lesson from a children\u2019s book, one in which a girl could </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">remember anything she wanted by saying \u201cclick,\u201d </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and imagining she held a camera). Later, distracted </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">on my walk home by the kiss\u2019s memory, which came </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">easily because my eyes had been closed for it, I took a wrong </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">turn and struggled to find my building </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on an unfamiliar street. That\u2019s why I\u2019m studying: </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There is my own blue bicycle; the round planter to the left </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of the steps I use to enter, which the downstairs neighbor keeps </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">tidy\u2014cutting back the plants that don\u2019t stay green </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the winter, for example, but keeping the heartier cabbages </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">watered\u2014though I have never seen her do this work; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">somewhere between two and five pride flags, </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">some of which are there year round while others </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">appear only in June; a fire hydrant; the windows </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">of the apartment that face mine, through which I see my least </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">favorite bookshelves: they look mildly expensive </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">and comprise a set of intersecting diamonds, making the books </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">hard to remove and reshelf since they are all piled at slants; </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">some scaffolding that seems to attract unhappy couples mid-fight; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">one set of table and chairs; a house that frequently puts books </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">or toys or clothes out on the sidewalk for free. I know that </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">there are two or more remarkable sculptures, but only </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">because I remember remarking: one might be of a silver </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">bust of a woman, maybe an angel or a pop star, while others </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">are definitely at the base of the railings to the steps across the street, but I don\u2019t </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">remember now if they are dogs or birds. There is a statue of an owl </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">on a window ledge I can see from one chair, and it often scares me. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now some buildings have Christmas lights, but I couldn\u2019t say </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">which, and that could easily lead me to turn down any other residential </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">block. There is a lilac bush immediately next door, and in May, it helped me </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">identify my building from very far away. But when we came </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to pick up our keys, I began to cry\u2014it resembles </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">another that grew in front of my childhood and I am </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">sentimental. I sat down and demanded my roommate tell me </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">why he hadn\u2019t pointed out the lilacs earlier, and he threw up </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his hands: he had tried, but I had talked over him. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">When the kisser who recommended I take snapshots </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of my surroundings came to my apartment, there is a chance </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">that they noticed many more things: they probably know </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">whether it is broken up at any point by vinyl siding, or what words </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">appear on the inflatable Santa down the hill. When we passed </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">through the park, I did attempt to capture the snow lifting </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">from the ground in spirals, the two bodies\u2014one seated, one running\u2014blocking </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">some light, the corner-eye view of their metallic jacket. But I <em>wanted</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">to remember what we looked like to the seated person, so replaced the above </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">description with an imagined photo of two people connected </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">by elbows, which I now see instead. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">My panic, when it comes in public, starts </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">with lost vision; at home, with the heart.
