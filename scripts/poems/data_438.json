Transparency's appealing, except it blinds us before day's begun. How I long to captain that table, to return in a beautiful accent a customer's request. My mother kneeled down against her client and cut threads from buttons with her teeth, inquiring with a finger in the band if it cut into the waist. Or pulled a hem down to a calf to cool a husband's collar. I can see this in my sleep and among notions. My bed was inches from the sewing machine, a dress on the chair forever weeping its luminescent frays. Sleep was the sound of insinuation, a zigzag to keep holes receptive. Or awakened by a backstitch balling under the foot. A needle cracking? Blood on a white suit? When my baby's asleep I write to no one and cannot expect a response. The fit's poor, always. No one wears it out the door. But fashions continue to fly out of magazines like girls out of windows. Sure, they are my sisters. Their machines, my own.

So he was the brake.<br />His face was bright pink.<br />He laughed a lot and explained<br /><br />everything. We weren't on the glacier<br />but on the runoff of gravelly snow<br />and ice and dirt that skirts<br />the glacier. \"The name for this\u2014<br />I forget it in English.\" We bumped<br />along. Tilted and jolted.<br />Lily sat up front, my arm around<br />her waist, her hair flickering<br />in my eyes. We almost tipped over<br />more than once. Then stopped<br />to let it in: the snapping wind,<br />that buffeting hum. And everything<br />cloud-colored: a gray sky<br /><br />falling into gray snow.<br />He took our picture with the dogs<br />and they were gray too: a patchwork<br />of gray and dark gray,<br />sandy browns and black, silvery<br />white; their long, coarse fur<br />greasy like duck feathers. \"Waterproof,\"<br />Jannick assured us, gloves off.<br />\"Feel how warm the skin is<br />under all this.\" They pulled against<br />their harnesses, anxious<br /><br />to get going again. Nosed us<br />as he called out their names:<br />\"Gandy, Darwin and Apollo,<br />Little Franka, Pedro, Bacon, Gnist.\"<br />These dogs once hunted polar bears<br />and seals. \"Well, not these<br />particular dogs, but the breed.\"<br />Now Darwin rolled over<br />on the crusty snow. Franka's<br />broad head was blunt and black<br />as an anvil. Lily cradled it<br />in her arms. \"You can't stay<br /><br />out long,\" Jannick said. \"Weather's<br />too chancy. Changes fast.\" So\u2014<br />we swung the sled around, retraced<br />the slushy ruts of sled tracks<br />and ski tracks. The other dogs<br />left behind at the camp cried<br />and barked as we drew near.<br />They could smell us before we could<br />see them. Back inside, he lit up<br />his pipe.
