I spend round after</p><p>round risking and taking damage,<br />in search of that perfect left hook</p><p>to the body, that soft midsection crunch.<br />I land a few home and feel the accuracy</p><p>moving deeper than mechanics,<br />burying itself in the blue memory</p><p>below. Inside the ring I sweat out everything<br />but bob and weave, but balance and breath, bearing</p><p>each combination\u2019s bad intent, until brutality<br />blossoms into something almost beautiful.</p><p>II.</p><p>And then it\u2019s time\u2014as in the dark, we\u2019re in it:<br />maternity wing of the hospital, the lengthening<br />hours of our son\u2019s slow arrival. As in the dark,<br />a contraction\u2019s wave ends, the wash of pain receding,<br />and L leans back into the rocking chair, back<br />into the chasm of exhaustion, eyelids<br />locking her exit from the room. I squat before her<br />and wait, her body buoyed in the open sea of labor,<br />as in the dark. My gaze \ufb01xes on the map<br />of monitors, scanning that pixilated horizon<br />for the next contraction\u2019s approach. When it does,<br />as in the dark, her eyes flare inside the room<br />once more, hands raising to clasp<br />behind my neck, as in the dark. I hear the moan<br />of her spirit bearing this being into light, and I lift<br />her loaded weight, place pressure<br />on her hips and say, <em>give me everything,</em><br /><em>darling</em>, as in the dark. There is no word for the in\ufb01nite<br />divide between my desire and my inability to rock<br />this boy\u2019s burden from her, to rock her from the tides<br />of hurt he\u2019s riding in on\u2014this is all her. As from the dark,<br />as from the sea, another wave builds inside her,<br />and I send whispers across water, coaching her deeper<br />into the swallow of its force, calling it <em>what we want</em>,<br />calling it <em>love </em>or <em>joy </em>or <em>peace</em>, as in the dark, barely trusting<br />each moment that moves her further from this shore,<br />where I wait for her, to plant our son into these arms.</p><p>III.</p><p>When they tell us no more fluids. When they tell us time<br />has scorched the well of his arrival. When urgency cuts through</p><p>each gowned voice in the delivery room, the ghost in L\u2019s face<br />says <em>let them</em>, and so we let them mine him by \ufb01re\u2014with and through \ufb01re.</p><p>Restraints. No breath. Regional anesthesia. No breath. Nerve block.<br />Incision. Hemorrhage. And then he adds the sharp thunder of his cry</p><p>to the elements. They place him at the altar of her chest. With one hand<br />free to touch the curl and moisture of his hair, smoke clears from her smile.</p><p>IV.</p><p>In the nursery, this new kind of quiet<br />stretches itself inside the plastic, hospital-issued bassinet,</p><p>and I stare at my feet\u2014<br />a sudden fear over the distance down</p><p>to them, over having no prayer for looking<br />into our son\u2019s face, years from now, \ufb01nding</p><p>it thinner, the flesh pulled tighter<br />around the cathedral of his skull,</p><p>the mind behind his eyes more<br />like ours, more tacked to the brittleness</p><p>of yesterday, days stacking into months,<br />memories like seeds spilled across another year.</p><p>What\u2019s the ritual for forgiving ourselves<br />the mortal promise we set in motion,</p><p>pressed between the floral sheets, \u00a0<br />planting his life\u2019s fabric into death\u2019s seam?</p> "}, {"title": "What I Mean When I Say Farmhouse", "view_node": "/poem/what-i-mean-when-i-say-farmhouse", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/geffrey-davis\" hreflang=\"en\">Geffrey Davis</a>", "field_date_published": "2015", "body": " <p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Time\u2019s going has ebbed the moorings<br />to the memories that make this city-kid</p><p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 part farm-boy.
