James Hiliman writes: \"Every rebirth fan-\ntasy in psychology may be a defense against depth.\" If com-\ning up out of the cave of night can mean an openness to know-\ning we've never left the cave, then rebirth ceases to be an-\ntagonistic to depth.\n\n                              *\n\nThe beginning of the construction of the underworld takes\nplace in Upper Paleolithic caves. To identify this \"place\nunder construction,\" I use the later Greek word \"Hades,\"\nand it is there that the first evidence of psyche we can \nrelate to occurs. To be in the cave is to be inside an an-\nimal--a womb--but to draw there is to seek another kind of\nbirth; an adjustment to the crisis of the animal separat-\ning out of the human--or, the Fall. To be inside, to be \nhidden, to be in Hades--where the human hides in the animal.\n\n                              *\n\nSemi-conscious scanning through the lich gate.

Its adamant muzzle \nconfers moisture on my deathly palm.\n\n                              *\n\nSince the hidden is bottomless, totality is more invisible \nthan visible. Insistence on a totality in which life is tot-\nally visible, is the anti-dream, Hades deprived of his cave, \nSatan attempting to establish a kingdom--or death camp--\nsolely on earth.\n\n                              *\n\nAs species disappear, the Upper Paleolithic grows more vivid. \nAs living animals disappear, the first outlines become more \ndear, not as reflections of a day world, but as the primal\noutlines of psyche, the shaping of the underworld, the point \nat which Hades was an animal.
