Our hopes, \nif they blossom, if they blossom at all, the petals \nand fruit fall. \n\nYou have given us the strength \nto serve You, \nbut we may serve or not \nas we please; \nnot for peace nor for prosperity, \nnot even for length of life, have we merited \nremembrance; remember us \nas the servants \nYou have inherited. \n\n\nII\n<i>Day of Atonement</i> \n\nThe great Giver has ended His disposing; \nthe long day \nis over and the gates are closing. \nHow badly all that has been read \nwas read by us, \nhow poorly all that should be said. \n\nAll wickedness shall go in smoke. \nIt must, it must! \nThe just shall see and be glad. \nThe sentence is sweet and sustaining; \nfor we, I suppose, are the just; \nand we, the remaining. \n\nIf only I could write with four pens between five fingers \nand with each pen a different sentence at the same time\u2014\nbut the rabbis say it is a lost art, a lost art. \nI well believe it. And at that of the first twenty sins that we confess, \nfive are by speech alone; \nlittle wonder that I must ask the Lord to bless \nthe words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart. \n\nNow, as from the dead, I revisit the earth and delight \nin the sky, and hear again \nthe noise of the city and see \nearth's marvelous creatures\u2014men. \nOut of nothing I became a being, \nand from a being I shall be \nnothing\u2014but until then \nI rejoice, a mote in Your world, \na spark in Your seeing. \n\n\nIII \n<i>Feast of Booths</i>\n\nThis was a season of our fathers' joy: \nnot only when they gathered grapes and the fruit of trees \nin Israel, but when, locked in the dark and stony streets, \nthey held\u2014symbols of a life from which they were banished \nbut to which they would surely return\u2014\nthe branches of palm trees and of willows, the twigs of the myrtle, \nand the bright odorous citrons. \n\nThis was the grove of palms with its deep well \nin the stony ghetto in the blaze of noon; \nthis the living stream lined with willows; \nand this the thick-leaved myrtles and trees heavy with fruit \nin the barren ghetto\u2014a garden \nwhere the unjustly hated were justly safe at last. \n\nIn booths this week of holiday \nas those who gathered grapes in Israel lived \nand also to remember we were cared for \nin the wilderness\u2014\nI remember how frail my present dwelling is\n even if of stones and steel. \n\nI know this is the season of our joy: \nwe have completed the readings of the Law \nand we begin again; \nbut I remember how slowly I have learnt, how little, \nhow fast the year went by, the years\u2014how few. \n\n\nIV\n<i>Hanukkah</i>\n\nThe swollen dead fish float on the water;\nthe dead birds lie in the dust trampled to feathers;\nthe lights have been out a long time and the quick gentle hands that lit them\u2014\nrosy in the yellow tapers' glow\u2014\nhave long ago become merely nails and little bones,\nand of the mouths that said the blessing and the minds that thought it\nonly teeth are left and skulls, shards of skulls.\nBy all means, then, let us have psalms\nand days of dedication anew to the old causes.\n\nPenniless, penniless, I have come with less and still less\nto this place of my need and the lack of this hour.\nThat was a comforting word the prophet spoke:\nNot by might nor by power but by My spirit, said the Lord;\ncomforting, indeed, for those who have neither might nor power\u2014\nfor a blade of grass, for a reed.\n\nThe miracle, of course, was not that the oil for the sacred light\u2014\nin a little cruse\u2014lasted as long as they say;\nbut that the courage of the Maccabees lasted to this day:\nlet that nourish my flickering spirit.\n\nGo swiftly in your chariot, my fellow Jew,\nyou who are blessed with horses;\nand I will follow as best I can afoot,\nbringing with me perhaps a word or two.\nSpeak your learned and witty discourses\nand I will utter my word or two\u2014\nnot by might not by power\nbut by Your Spirit, Lord.</pre>\n<!---<a href=\"http://www.poets.org/tellafriend.php/prmURL/%5Eviewmedia.php%5EprmMID%5E16820\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/send_blue_bow.jpg\" border=0 align=right></a>---> "}, {"title": "Notes on the Spring Holidays, III, [Hanukkah]", "view_node": "/poem/notes-spring-holidays-iii-hanukkah", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/charles-reznikoff\" hreflang=\"und\">Charles Reznikoff</a>", "field_date_published": "1976", "body": " <pre>\nIII\n<i>Hanukkah</i>\n\nIn a world where each man must be of use\nand each thing useful, the rebellious Jews\nlight not one light but eight\u2014\nnot to see by but to look at.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Te Deum", "view_node": "/poem/te-deum", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/charles-reznikoff\" hreflang=\"und\">Charles Reznikoff</a>", "field_date_published": "1976", "body": " <pre>\nNot because of victories\nI sing,\nhaving none,\nbut for the common sunshine,\nthe breeze,\nthe largess of the spring.\n\nNot for victory\nbut for the day's work done\nas well as I was able;\nnot for a seat upon the dais\nbut at the common table.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Infant Joy", "view_node": "/poem/infant-joy", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/william-blake\" hreflang=\"und\">William Blake</a>", "field_date_published": "1789", "body": " <pre>\n\"I have no name:\nI am but two days old.\"\nWhat shall I call thee?\n\"I happy am,\nJoy is my name.\"\nSweet joy befall thee!\n\nPretty joy!\nSweet joy, but two days old.\nSweet Joy I call thee:\nThou dost smile,\nI sing the while;\nSweet joy befall thee!</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Feast of Lights", "view_node": "/poem/feast-lights", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/emma-lazarus\" hreflang=\"und\">Emma Lazarus</a>", "field_date_published": "1882", "body": " <pre>\nKindle the taper like the steadfast star\nAblaze on evening's forehead o'er the earth,\nAnd add each night a lustre till afar\nAn eightfold splendor shine above thy hearth.\nClash, Israel, the cymbals, touch the lyre,\nBlow the brass trumpet and the harsh-tongued horn;\nChant psalms of victory till the heart takes fire,\nThe Maccabean spirit leap new-born.\n\nRemember how from wintry dawn till night,\nSuch songs were sung in Zion, when again\nOn the high altar flamed the sacred light,\nAnd, purified from every Syrian stain,\nThe foam-white walls with golden shields were hung,\nWith crowns and silken spoils, and at the shrine,\nStood, midst their conqueror-tribe, five chieftains sprung\nFrom one heroic stock, one seed divine.\n\nFive branches grown from Mattathias' stem,\nThe Blessed John, the Keen-Eyed Jonathan,\nSimon the fair, the Burst-of Spring, the Gem,\nEleazar, Help of-God;
