heat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To drink there.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">In the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I came down the steps with my pitcher</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at <span class=\"long-line\">the trough before me.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over the edge\u00a0</span><span class=\"long-line\">of the stone trough</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And rested his throat upon the stone bottom,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He sipped with his straight mouth,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Softly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Silently.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Someone was before me at my water-trough,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I, like a second-comer, waiting.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a moment,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And stooped and drank a little more,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The voice of my education said to me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He must be killed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And voices in me said, If you were a man</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But must I confess how I liked him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-trough</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the burning bowels of this earth?</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Was it humility, to feel honoured?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I felt so honoured.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And yet those voices:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If you were not afraid you would kill him.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But even so, honoured still more</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That he should seek my hospitality</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From out the dark door of the secret earth.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">He drank enough</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Seeming to lick his lips,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And slowly turned his head,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round\u00a0</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered further,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that horrid black hole,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Overcame me now his back was turned.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I looked round, I put down my pitcher,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I picked up a clumsy log</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I think it did not hit him,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in undignified haste,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Writhed like lightning, and was gone</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And immediately I regretted it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I despised myself and the voices of my accurs\u00e8d human education.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And I thought of the albatross,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I wished he would come back, my snake.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">For he seemed to me again like a king,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now due to be crowned again.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of life.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And I have something to expiate:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A pettiness.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Venice Elegy 2 Rot Poem", "view_node": "/poem/venice-elegy-2-rot-poem", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/yang-lian\" hreflang=\"en\">Yang Lian</a>",
