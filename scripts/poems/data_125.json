The oculus opens an O to the sky, where the starry outlines of men float like air bubbles between us and oblivion. Once there were oarfish, opaleyes, olive flounders. Once the oxbows were not overrun with nitrogen. O for the mussels opening in the ocean\u2019s oven. O for the rising ozone, the dropping oxygen, for algae overblooming like an omen or an oracle.

and scattered cacti. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down the street garage doors slid shut as neighbors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">maneuvered out of curved driveways to begin the
