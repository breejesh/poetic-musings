snow,\nIn the bleak mid-winter \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long ago.\n\nOur God, Heaven cannot hold Him\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor earth sustain;\nHeaven and earth shall flee away\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When He comes to reign:\nIn the bleak midwinter\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A stable-place sufficed\nThe Lord God Almighty\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jesus Christ.\n\nEnough for Him, whom cherubim\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worship night and day,\nA breastful of milk\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And a mangerful of hay;\nEnough for Him, whom angels\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fall down before,\nThe ox and ass and camel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which adore.\n\nAngels and archangels\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May have gathered there,\nCherubim and seraphim\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thronged the air;\nBut only His mother\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In her maiden bliss\nWorshipped the Beloved\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a kiss.\n\nWhat can I give Him,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poor as I am?\nIf I were a shepherd\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would bring a lamb,\nIf I were a Wise Man\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would do my part,\u2014\nYet what I can I give Him,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Give my heart.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Power of the Dog", "view_node": "/poem/power-dog",

way</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From men and women to fill our day;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And when we are certain of sorrow in store,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Why do we always arrange for more?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><i>Brothers and Sisters, I bid you beware</i></span><br /><i><span class=\"long-line\">Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.</span></i></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Buy a pup and your money will buy</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Love unflinching that cannot lie\u2014</span><br /><span

fair</i></span><br /><i><span class=\"long-line\">To risk your heart for a dog to tear.</span></i></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">When the fourteen years which Nature permits</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the vet\u2019s unspoken prescription runs</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To lethal chambers or loaded guns,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><i>Then you will find\u2014it\u2019s your own affair\u2014</i></span><br /><i><span class=\"long-line\">But\u2026 you\u2019ve given your heart to a dog to tear.</span></i></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">When the body that lived at your single will,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With its whimper of welcome, is stilled (how still!).</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the spirit that answered your every mood</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is gone\u2014wherever it goes\u2014for good,</span><br /><span

given, but only lent,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At compound interest of cent per cent.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Though it is not always the case, I believe,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That the longer we\u2019ve kept \u2019em, the more do we grieve:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A short-time loan is as bad as a long\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><i>So why in\u2014Heaven (before we are there)</i></span><br /><i><span class=\"long-line\">Should

/><span class=\"long-line\">Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And how else can it be?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter\u2019s oven?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Some of you say, \u201cJoy is greater than sorrow,\u201d and others say, \u201cNay, sorrow is the greater.\u201d</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I say unto you, they are inseparable.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Bleezer&#039;s Ice Cream", "view_node": "/poem/bleezers-ice-cream", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jack-prelutsky\" hreflang=\"und\">Jack Prelutsky</a>",
