More of a success at it this time than most\n        others it is. The feeling that the sky might be in the back of someone's\n        mind. Then there is no telling how many there are. They grace\n        everything--bush and tree--to take the roisterer's mind off his\n        caroling--so it's like a smooth switch back. To what was aired in\n        their previous conniption fit. There is so much to be seen everywhere\n        that it's like not getting used to it, only there is so much it\n        never feels new, never any different. You are standing looking at that\n        building and you cannot take it all in, certain details are already hazy\n        and the mind boggles. What will it all be like in five years' time\n        when you try to remember? Will there have been boards in between the\n        grass part and the edge of the street? As long as that couple is\n        stopping to look in that window over there we cannot go. We feel like\n        they have to tell us we can, but they never look our way and they are\n        already gone, gone far into the future--the night of time. If we could\n        look at a photograph of it and say there they are, they never really\n        stopped but there they are. There is so much to be said, and on the\n        surface of it very little gets said.\n        \n There ought to be room for more things, for a spreading out, like.\n        Being immersed in the details of rock and field and slope --letting them\n        come to you for once, and then meeting them halfway would be so much\n        easier--if they took an ingenuous pride in being in one's blood.\n        Alas, we perceive them if at all as those things that were meant to be\n        put aside-- costumes of the supporting actors or voice trilling at the\n        end of a narrow enclosed street. You can do nothing with them. Not even\n        offer to pay.\n        \n It is possible that finally, like coming to the end of a long,\n        barely perceptible rise, there is mutual cohesion and interaction. The\n        whole scene is fixed in your mind, the music all present, as though you\n        could see each note as well as hear it. I say this because there is an\n        uneasiness in things just now. Waiting for something to be over before\n        you are forced to notice it. The pollarded trees scarcely bucking the\n        wind--and yet it's keen, it makes you fall over. Clabbered sky.\n        Seasons that pass with a rush. After all it's their time\n        too--nothing says they aren't to make something of it. As for Jenny\n        Wren, she cares, hopping about on her little twig like she was tryin'\n        to tell us somethin', but that's just it, she couldn't\n        even if she wanted to--dumb bird. But the others--and they in some way\n        must know too--it would never occur to them to want to, even if they\n        could take the first step of the terrible journey toward feeling\n        somebody should act, that ends in utter confusion and hopelessness, east\n        of the sun and west of the moon. So their comment is: \"No comment.\"\n        Meanwhile the whole history of probabilities is coming to life, starting\n        in the upper left-hand corner, like a sail.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Ken Burns", "view_node": "/poem/ken-burns", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/sean-singer\" hreflang=\"und\">Sean Singer</a>", "field_date_published": "2002", "body": " <pre></pre>\n<center><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><i>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \"There\u2019s no such thing as bop music, but there\u2019s<br />\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 such a thing as progress.\"\u2014Coleman Hawkins</i></p></center><p>Although jazz\u2019s sepia, acetates, and lacquers<br />have dipped the black into silver nitrate,<br />and are faded little faders, they inflate like lungs.</p><p>The pink lung, with its tortoiseshell shellac<br />appears to bulge, and its inseam exhales<br />purity, and inhales spoonfuls of tempo.</p><p>Purity in jazz, sir, is thwarted and unutilized.<br />Two hundred years of minstrels, snapping<br />their red suspenders, corrode and oxidize the air.</p><p>Mr. Tambo: <i>What kind of a girl was she? </i><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Zip: <i>She was highly polished; yes, indeed.
