split off the mountain mass\u2014<br />And hopeless grist enough it looks<br />Ever to grind to\u00a0soil\u00a0for grass.<br />(The way it is will do for moss.)<br />There he had built his stolen shack.<br />It had to be a stolen shack<br />Because of the fears of fire and loss<br />That trouble the sleep of lumber folk:<br />Visions of half the world burned black<br />And the sun\u00a0shrunken\u00a0yellow in smoke.<br />We know who when they come to town<br />Bring berries under the wagon seat,<br />Or a basket of eggs between their feet;<br />What this man brought in a cotton sack<br />Was gum, the gum of the mountain spruce.<br />He showed me lumps of the scented stuff<br />Like uncut jewels, dull and rough.<br />It comes to market golden brown;<br />But turns to pink between the teeth.<br /><br />I told him this is a pleasant life<br />To set your breast to the bark of trees<br />That all your days are dim beneath,<br />And reaching up with a little knife,<br />To\u00a0loose\u00a0the resin and take it down<br />And bring it to market when you please.</p><p>\u00a0</p> "}, {"title": "Brown&#039;s Descent, or the Willy-Nilly Slide", "view_node":

lofty farm<br />\u00a0 That everyone for miles could see<br />His lantern when he did his chores<br />\u00a0 In winter after half-past three.<br /><br />And many must have seen him make<br />\u00a0 His wild descent from there one night,<br />\u2019Cross lots, \u2019cross walls, \u2019cross everything,<br />\u00a0 Describing rings of lantern light.<br /><br />Between the house and barn the gale<br />\u00a0 Got him by something he had on<br />And blew him out on the icy crust<br />\u00a0 That cased the world, and he was gone!<br /><br />Walls were all buried, trees were few:<br />\u00a0 He saw no stay unless he stove<br />A hole in somewhere with his heel.<br />\u00a0 But though repeatedly he strove<br /><br />And stamped and said things to himself,<br />\u00a0 And sometimes something seemed to yield,<br />He gained no\u00a0foothold,\u00a0but pursued<br />\u00a0 His journey down from field to field.<br /><br />Sometimes he came with arms outspread<br />\u00a0 Like wings, revolving in the scene<br />Upon his longer axis, and<br />\u00a0 With no small dignity of mien.<br /><br />Faster or slower as he chanced,<br />\u00a0 Sitting or standing as he chose,<br />According as he feared to risk<br />\u00a0 His neck, or thought to spare his clothes,<br /><br />He never let the lantern drop.<br />\u00a0 And some exclaimed who saw afar<br />The figures he described with it,<br />\u00a0 \u201dI wonder what those signals are<br /><br />Brown makes at such an hour of\u00a0night!<br />\u00a0 He\u2019s celebrating something strange.<br />I wonder if he\u2019s sold his farm,<br />\u00a0 Or been made Master of the Grange.\u201d<br /><br />He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;<br />\u00a0 He fell and made the lantern rattle<br />(But saved the light from going out.)<br />\u00a0 So half-way down he fought the battle<br /><br />Incredulous of his own bad luck.<br />\u00a0 And then becoming reconciled<br />To everything, he gave it up<br />\u00a0 And came down like a coasting child.<br /><br />\u201cWell\u2014I\u2014be\u2014\u201d that was all he said,<br />\u00a0\u00a0As standing in the river road,<br />He looked back up the slippery slope<br />\u00a0 (Two miles it was) to his abode.<br /><br />Sometimes as an authority<br />\u00a0 On motor-cars, I\u2019m asked if I<br />Should say our stock was petered out,<br />\u00a0 And this is my sincere reply:<br /><br />Yankees are what they always were.<br />\u00a0 Don\u2019t think Brown ever gave up hope<br />Of getting home again because<br />\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t climb that slippery slope;<br /><br />Or even thought of standing there<br />\u00a0 Until the January\u00a0thaw<br />Should take the polish off the crust.<br />\u00a0 He bowed with grace to natural law,<br /><br />And then went round it on his feet,<br />\u00a0 After the manner of our stock;<br />Not much concerned for those to whom,<br />\u00a0 At that particular time o\u2019clock,<br /><br />It must have looked as if the course<br />\u00a0 He steered was really straight away<br />From that which he was headed for\u2014<br />\u00a0 Not much concerned for them, I say:<br /><br />No more so than became a man\u2014<br />\u00a0 And politician at odd seasons.<br />I\u2019ve kept Brown standing in the cold<br />\u00a0 While I invested him with reasons;<br /><br />But now he snapped his eyes three times;<br />\u00a0 Then shook his lantern, saying, \u201cIle\u2019s<br />\u2019Bout out!\u201d and took the long way home<br />\u00a0 By road, a matter of several miles.</p> "}, {"title": "&quot;Out, Out\u2014&quot;", "view_node":
