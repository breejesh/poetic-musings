We enclose them like dolls in glass cases and decorate our houses with them.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People, especially the cultivated ones from old families, live surrounded by multitudes of dignified dead. Our living rooms and parlors, even our dining rooms and our bedrooms, are filled with our ancestors in glass cases. When the rooms become too full, we use the cases for furniture.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On top of where my twenty-five-year-old great-grandmother lies, beautiful and buried in flowers, we line up the evening soup bowls.</p>\n\n<p><b>2</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not sing in chorus. When four people gather, we weave together four different melodies. This is what we call a relationship. Such encounters are always a sort of entanglement.

After thirty years, those faces we wished to see never again enter our fields of vision.</p>\n\n<p><b>4</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this country, everyone fears midday. In the daytime, the dead are too dead. Bathed in the sharp view of the sun, our skin crawls, and we shudder.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the nights, vast and deaf, vast and blind, descend with size great enough to fill the distances between us, we remove our corsets and breathe with relief. When we lie down to sleep at the bottom of the darkness, we are nearly as content as the corpses around us.</p>\n\n<p><b>5</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sight of fresh new leaves scares us. Who is to say that those small buds raising their faces upon the branches are not our own nipples? Who is to say that the soft, double blades of grass stretching from the wet earth are not the slightly parted lips of a boy?</p>\n\n<p><b>6</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the springtime, when green begins to invade our world, there is no place for us to take refuge outside, and so we hide in the deepest, darkest recesses of our houses. Sometimes we crane our necks from where we hide between our dead brothers, and we gaze at the green hemisphere swelling before our eyes. We are troubled by many fevers; we live with thermometers tucked under our arms.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do you know what it means to be a woman, especially to be a woman in this country, during the spring?<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I was fifteen, becoming a woman frightened me. When I was eighteen, being a woman struck me as loathsome. Now, how old am I? I have become too much of a woman. I can no longer return to being human; that age is gone forever. My head is small, my neck long, and my hair terribly heavy.</p>\n\n<p><b>7</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We can smile extremely well. So affable are our smiles that they are always mistaken for the real thing. Nonetheless, if by some chance our smiles should go awry, we fall into a terrible state. Our jaws slacken, and our faces disintegrate into so many parts.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When this happens, we cover our faces with our handkerchiefs and withdraw. Shutting ourseleves alone in a room, we wait quietly until our natural grimace returns.</p>\n\n<p><b>8</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During our meals, sometimes a black, glistening insect will dart diagonally across the table. People know perfectly well where this giant insect comes from. When it dashes between the salad and the loaf of bread, people fall silent for a moment, then continue as if nothing had happened.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The insect has no name. That is because nobody has ever dared talk about it.</p>\n\n<p><b>9</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three times each day, all of the big buildings sound sirens. The elementary schools, theaters, and even the police stations raise a long wail like that of a chained beast suffering from terrible tedium.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No matter where one is in this country, one cannot escape this sound\u2014not even if one is making love, not even if one peering into the depths of a telescope.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, there are many telescopes in this country. There is always a splendid telescope at each major intersection in town. People here like to see things outside of their own country. Every day many people, while looking through the lens of one of these telescopes, are struck by stray cars and killed.</p>\n\n<p><b>10</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the faint aroma of the tide wafts upon the wind into town, people remember that this country lies by the sea. This sea, however, is not there for us to navigate; it is there to shut us in. The waves are not there to carry us; they continue their eternal movement so we will give up all hope.<br />\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like the waves that roll slowly from the shore, we sigh heavily. We throw our heads back, then hang them in resignation. We crumple to the ground, our skirts fanning over the dunes...</p>\n\n<p><b>11</b></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ignorant of all this, trading ships laden with unknown products, move into the harbor. People speak in unknown languages; unknown faces appear and disappear.
