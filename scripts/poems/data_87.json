Sometimes this lady screams through the wall that you're a whore and he's a faggot or mumbles under her breath when you pass her in the hallway, the street, the bodega.

Stendhal\u2019s own argument also entails a critique of terminology: of <em>thunderbolts</em>, he says, <em>That ridiculous word ought to be changed\u2014but nevertheless the thing \u201clove at first sight\u201d does exist</em>.\u00a0</p>\n<p>When I first copied down those sentences from Stendhal, I wrote instead of <em>upheaval</em> the nonword <em>unheaval</em>, which I now think of as <em>upheaval</em>\u2019s uncompromised sibling.
