Of course, Eurydice was a part\nOf this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends\nRocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks\nCan't withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon\nTo the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.\nThen Apollo quietly told him: \"Leave it all on earth.\nYour lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to \nFollow, except a few birds of dusty feather,\nNot vivid performances of the past.\" But why not?\nAll other things must change too.\nThe seasons are no longer what they once were,\nBut it is the nature of things to be seen only once,\nAs they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along\nSomehow. That's where Orpheus made his mistake.\nOf course Eurydice vanished into the shade;\nShe would have even if he hadn't turned around.\nNo use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel\nOf recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to \n   utter an intelligent\nComment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.\nOnly love stays on the brain, and something these people,\nThese other ones, call life. Singing accurately\nSo that the notes mount straight up out of the well of\nDim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers\nGrowing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulizes\nThe different weights of the things. \n\t\t\t\t\tBut it isn't enough\nTo just go on singing. Orpheus realized this\nAnd didn't mind so much about his reward being in heaven\nAfter the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven\nHalf out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.\nSome say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.\nBut probably the music had more to do with it, and\nThe way music passes, emblematic\nOf life and how you cannot isolate a note of it\nAnd say it is good or bad. You must\nWait till it's over. \"The end crowns all,\"\nMeaning also that the \"tableau\"\nIs wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,\nMelt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure\nThat stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;\nIt is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,\nOver which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,\nHarsh strokes. And to ask more than this\nIs to become the tossing reeds of that slow, \nPowerful stream, the trailing grasses\nPlayfully tugged at, but to participate in the action\nNo more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky\nElectric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth\nInto a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses\nHave each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks, \n\"I'm a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,\nThough I can understand the language of birds, and\nThe itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is \n   fully apparent to me.\nTheir jousting ends in music much\nAs trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm\nAnd is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, \n   day after day.\"\n\nBut how late to be regretting all this, even\nBearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!\nTo which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,\nReplies that these are of course not regrets at all,\nMerely a careful, scholarly setting down of\nUnquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.\nAnd no matter how all this disappeared,\nOr got where it was going, it is no longer\nMaterial for a poem. Its subject\nMatters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly\nWhile the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad\nComet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward\nThat the meaning, good or other, can never\nBecome known. The singer thinks\nConstructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages\nLike a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.\nThe song is engulfed in an instant in blackness\nWhich must in turn flood the whole continent\nWith blackness, for it cannot see. The singer\nMust then pass out of sight, not even relieved\nOf the evil burthen of the words. Stellification\nIs for the few, and comes about much later\nWhen all record of these people and their lives\nHas disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm.\nA few are still interested in them. \"But what about\nSo-and-so?\" is still asked on occasion. But they lie\nFrozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorus\nSpeaks of a totally different incident with a similar name\nIn whose tale are hidden syllables\nOf what happened so long before that\nIn some small town, one indifferent summer. \n</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Medusa", "view_node": "/poem/medusa-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/patricia-smith\" hreflang=\"und\">Patricia Smith</a>", "field_date_published": "1992", "body": " <pre>\nPoseidon was easier than most.\nHe calls himself a god,\nbut he fell beneath my fingers\nwith more shaking than any mortal.\nHe wept when my robe fell from my shoulders.\n\nI made him bend his back for me,\nlistened to his screams break like waves.\nWe defiled that temple the way it should be defiled,\nscreaming and bucking our way from corner to corner.\nThe bitch goddess probably got a real kick out of that.\nI'm sure I'll be hearing from her.\n\nShe'll give me nightmares for a week or so;\n<i>that</i> I can handle.\nOr she'll turn the water in my well into blood;\nI'll scream when I see it,\nand that will be that.\nMaybe my first child \nwill be born with the head of a fish.\nI'm not even sure it was worth it,\nPoseidon pounding away at me, a madman,\nlosing his immortal mind\nbecause of the way my copper skin swells in moonlight.\n\nNow my arms smoke and itch.\nHard scales cover my wrists like armour.\nC'mon Athena, he was only another lay,\nand not a particularly good one at that,\neven though he can spit steam from his fingers.\nWon't touch him again.
