Are our problems. Legacies rolling out like multicolored marbles. Don\u2019t focus so much on the \u2018doom and gloom\u2019 they keep saying. We don\u2019t want to depress. Everyone. This is only our survival. We rely heavily on foreign aid I am instructed to say. I am instructed to point out the need for funds to build islands, move families from weto after weto, my mouth a shovel to spade the concrete with but I am just pointing out neediness. So needy. These small. Underdeveloped countries. I feel myself shrinking in the back of the taxi when a diplomat compliments me. How brave for admitting it so openly. The allure of global negotiations dulls. Like the back of a worn spoon.</p>\n<p>I lose myself easily in a kemem. Kemem defined as feast. As celebration. A baby\u2019s breath endures their first year so we pack hundreds of close bodies under tents, lined up for plates I pass to my cousin, assembly line style. Our gloved hands pluck out barbeque chicken, fried fish, scoop potato salad, dew-like droplets of b\u014db and m\u0101. Someone yells for another container of jajimi. The speaker warbles a keyboarded song. A child inevitably cries. Mine dances in the middle of the party. A pair elbow each other to rip hanging beach balls from their strings. The MC shouts Boke ajiri ne nejim jen maan. The children are obstructing our view. Someone wheels a grandma onto the dance floor. The dances begin here</p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">is a nice </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">celebration </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of survival. </span></p>\n"}, {"title": "the
