My name is George</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Washington</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Carver.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If you bear with me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for a few minutes I</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">will share with you</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a few</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of the 30,117 uses to which</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the lowly peanut has been put</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">by me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">since yesterday afternoon.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If you will look at my feet you will notice</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">my sensible shoelaces made from unadulterated</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">peanut leaf composition that is biodegradable</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in the extreme.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To your left you can observe the lovely Renoir</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">masterpiece reproduction that I have cleverly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pieced together from several million peanut</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">shell chips painted painstakingly so as to</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">accurately represent the colors of the original!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Overhead you will spot a squadron of Peanut B-52</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Bombers flying due west.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I would extend my hands to greet you</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">at this time</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">except for the fact that I am holding a reserve</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">supply of high energy dry roasted peanuts</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">guaranteed to accelerate protein assimilation</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">precisely documented by my pocket peanut calculator;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">May I ask when did you last contemplate the relationship</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">between the expanding peanut products industry</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and the development of post-Marxian economic theory</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">which (Let me emphasize) need not exclude moral attrition</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of prepuberty</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">polymorphic</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">prehensile skills within the population age sectors</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of 8 to 15?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I hope you will excuse me if I appear to be staring at you</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">through these functional yet high fashion and prescriptive</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">peanut contact lenses providing for the most</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">minute observation of your physical response to all of this</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">ultimately nutritional information.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Peanut butter peanut soap peanut margarine peanut</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">brick houses and house and field peanut per se well</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">illustrate the diversified</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">potential of this lowly leguminous plant</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to which you may correctly refer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">also</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as the goober the pindar the groundnut</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and the ground pea/let me</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">interrupt to take your name down on my</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">pocket peanut writing pad complete with matching</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">peanut pencil that only 3 or 4</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">chewing motions of the jaws will sharpen</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into pyrotechnical utility</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and no sweat.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Please:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Speak right into the peanut!</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Your name?</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "The Bombing of Baghdad", "view_node": "/poem/bombing-baghdad", "field_author": "<a

We will be richer</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">than anyone in heaven, I said.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We stole from parlors the dying embers,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">gathered the porcelain figurines.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">On the fizzled trees, leaves</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">clanged like spoons. Our shopping cart</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">squeaked down the cobblestone street.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Saw-toothed lightning slashed the sky.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Will there be music, you asked,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on the other side?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We listened through wind-vents</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for echoes of earthquakes, listened for God</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">until the radio died. A hawk floated down</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like a frayed paper crane,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">snagged its claws on the electrical wire.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We crumbled the hands</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from statues of saints. Beneath the cathedrals</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">were underground trains</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and we rode every one of them to its end.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Each station was a burned-out lantern.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I want to go home, you cried,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but even the ferries bobbing on the docks</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">had cancelled their passages.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We sat in the dark eating crusts of stale bread.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Come with me, I said.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We stumbled beneath the starless night.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We climbed the vacant streets.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From the crown of the bald,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">illuminated hill, the city\u2019s windows</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">dazzled.
