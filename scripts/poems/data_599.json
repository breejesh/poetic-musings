Holiday,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">are you with us on this beach today.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hemisphere of one, my soul, paratrooper,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">greatness I house in my body, deepset, my</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">hands on these triggers\u2014who once could outrun</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his brother\u2014consumed with fellow-feeling like a madness that does not</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">must not,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">lower its pitch\u2014going to the meeting place,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the spire of the church in Vierville, seen on aerial maps, visible from</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">eighteen miles out,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">if it weren't for fog, and smoke, and groundmist,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the meeting place, the appointed time surging in me,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">needing to be pierced\u2014but not me\u2014not me\u2014</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">only those to the left and right of me\u2014</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">permit me to let you see me\u2014</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Me. Driven half mad but still in biography.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By the shared misery of. Hatred. Training. Trust. Fear.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Listening to the chatter each night of those who survived the day.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">There is no other human relationship like it.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">At its heart comradeship is an ecstasy.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You will die for an other. You will not consider it a personal</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">loss. Private Kurt Gabel, 513 Parachute Infantry Regiment\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"The three of us Jake, Joe and I became an entity.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">An entity\u2014never to be relinquished, never to be</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">repeated. An entity is where a man literally insists</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">on going hungry for another. A man insists on dying for</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">an other. Protect. Bail out. No regard to</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">consequence. A mystical concoction.\" A last piece</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of bread. And gladly. You must understand what is meant by</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\"><em>gladly</em>. All armies throughout history have tried</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">to create this bond among their men. Few succeeded as well</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as the paratroop infantry of the U.S. Army,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rifle Company E, 506th.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Fussell: It can't happen to me. It can happen to me. It is</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">going to happen to me. Nothing</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is going to prevent it.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Webster (to his parents): I am living on borrowed time\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I do not think I shall live through the next jump.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">If I don't come back, try not to take it too hard.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I wish I could persuade you to regard death</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">as casually as we do over here. In the heat of it</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">you expect it, you are expecting it, you are not surprised</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">by anything anymore, not surprised when your friend</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">is machine-gunned in the face. It's not like your life, at home,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">where death is so unexpected. (And to mother):</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">would you prefer for someone else's son to die in the mud?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And there is no way out short of the end of war or the loss</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of limb. Any other wound is patched up and you're sent back</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">to the front. This wound which almost killed him</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">healed up as well and he went back.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He never volunteered. One cannot volunteer.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">If death comes, friend, let it come quick.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And don't play the hero, there is no past or future. Don't play</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the hero. Ok. Let's go. Move out. Say goodbye.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Heaven for Helen", "view_node": "/poem/heaven-helen", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/mark-doty\" hreflang=\"und\">Mark Doty</a>", "field_date_published": "2005", "body": " <pre>\nHelen says heaven, for her,\nwould be complete immersion\nin physical process,\nwithout self-consciousness\u2014\n\nto be the respiration of the grass,\nor ionized agitation\njust above the break of a wave,\ntraffic in a sunflower's thousand golden rooms.\n\nImages of exchange,\nand of untrammeled nature.\nBut if we're to become part of it all,\nwon't our paradise also involve\n\nparticipation in being, say,\ndiesel fuel, the impatience of trucks\non August pavement,\nweird glow of service areas\n\nalong the interstate at night?\nWe'll be shiny pink egg cartons,\nand the thick treads of burst tires\nalong the highways in Pennsylvania:\n\na hell we've made to accompany\nthe given: we will join\nour tiresome productions,\nthings that want to be useless forever.\n\nBut that's me talking.
