Who gets to measure the distance between experience and its representation? Who controls the lines of inquiry? We do. Anyone can.</p><p><em>Blackbird</em>, he says. So be it, indexed and normative. But it isn\u2019t a bird, it\u2019s a man in a bird suit, blue shoulders instead of feathers, because he isn\u2019t looking at a bird, real bird, as he paints, he is looking at his heart, which is impossible.</p><p>Unless his heart is a metaphor for his heart, as everything is a metaphor for itself, so that looking at the paint is like looking at a bird that isn\u2019t there, with a song in its throat that you don\u2019t want to hear but you paint anyway.</p><p>The hand is a voice that can sing what the voice will not, and the hand wants to do something useful. <em>Sometimes, at night, in bed, before I fall asleep, I think about a poem I might write, someday, about my heart</em>, says the heart.</p><p><br />3</p><p>They looked at the animals. They looked at the walls of the cave. This is earlier, these are different men. They painted in torchlight: red mostly, sometimes black\u2014mammoth, lion, horse, bear\u2014things on a wall, in profile or superimposed, dynamic and alert.</p><p>They weren\u2019t animals but they looked like animals, enough like animals to make it confusing, meant something but the meaning was slippery: it wasn\u2019t there but it remained, looked like the thing but wasn\u2019t the thing\u2014was a second thing, following a second set of rules\u2014and it was too late: their power over it was no longer absolute.</p><p>What is alive and what isn\u2019t and what should we do about it? Theories: about the nature of the thing. And of the soul. Because people die. The fear: that nothing survives. The greater fear: that something does.</p><p>The night sky is vast and wide.</p><p>They huddled closer, shoulder to shoulder, painted themselves in herds, all together and apart from the rest. They looked at the sky, and at the mud, and at their hands in the mud, and their dead friends in the mud. This went on for a long time.</p><p><br />4</p><p>To be a bird, or a flock of birds doing something together, one or many, starling or murmuration. To be a man on a hill, or all the men on all the hills, or half a man shivering in the flock of himself. These are some choices.</p><p>The night sky is vast and wide.</p><p>A man had two birds in his head\u2014not in his throat, not in his chest\u2014and the birds would sing all day never stopping.

Tears,\nthe air inside a woman's dress,\nthe deep breath of non-ambition.\n\nIn a valley of stone,\nmen had to carry stones.\nIn a sea of fertility,\nwomen could drown\nin the wake of conceptions.\n\nWe no longer build in stone\u2014\nhouses of rice paper, beds\nof feather. Manhood\nis the one stone we still\ninsist on, lifting it\n\nFrom abandoned quarries,\ncarrying it on our backs\neven when we make love,\nuntil the woman beneath us\ncalls passion a kind of\n\nSuffocation, surfaces for air\nlike a young child whose head\nhas been pushed beneath the water,\na way to learn swimming.\n\n<i>Did you come?</i> we ask,\nher head bobbing above the brine\nthat pours from us. Applause\nis what we want now,\n\nHer wet hands\nclapping in the last wind\nbefore she sinks again,\nbefore she holds us again\nso tight we both plunge\nlike a cry for help\ninto the water,\n\nBefore we fall to the bottom\u2014\n\nStones\nnot even the fish\nwill pause to tell apart.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Jew", "view_node": "/poem/jew", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/michael-blumenthal\" hreflang=\"und\">Michael Blumenthal</a>", "field_date_published": "1980", "body": " <pre>\nfor Isaac Bashevis Singer\n\n\nThe melancholy of Chopin and cruel breathing\nfolds back your sheets,\nand you rise like lightly leavened bread,\nlike all the old, arthritic Jews left in the world,\nfrom your Sabbatical sleep.\n\nYou rise and wipe the crusted blood\nfrom your doorpost, kiss the angled <i>mezuzah</i>,\nand are grateful you have again been spared\nthe pestilence and the lice,\nthe hailstones and the fissuring earth,\nthe ambiguous knife of Abraham.\n\nYou go to the window, and through the Jew-eyes\nof this life you watch children stomp\ntheir booted feet against the sidewalk,\ngrandmothers and grandfathers sew yellow stars\nonto their lapels and wrap their hungry bones\nin the long phylacteries.\n\nIt is 1979, you know it, but you have slept\nlike a Jew.
