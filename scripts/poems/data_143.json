I was in his house. His wife carried a tray of coffee and sugar. His daughter filed her nails, his son went out for the night. There were daily papers, pet dogs, a pistol on the cushion beside him. The moon swung bare on its black cord over the house. On the television was a cop show. It was in English. Broken bottles were embedded in the walls around the house to scoop the kneecaps from a man's legs or cut his hands to lace. On the windows there were gratings like those in liquor stores. We had dinner, rack of lamb, good wine, a gold bell was on the table for calling the maid. The maid brought green mangoes, salt, a type of bread. I was asked how I enjoyed the country. There was a brief commercial in Spanish. His wife took everything away. There was some talk then of how difficult it had become to govern. The parrot said hello on the terrace. The colonel told it to shut up, and pushed himself from the table. My friend said to me with his eyes: say nothing. The colonel returned with a sack used to bring groceries home. He spilled many human ears on the table. They were like dried peach halves. There is no other way to say this. He took one of them in his hands, shook it in our faces, dropped it into a water glass. It came alive there. I am tired of fooling around he said. As for the rights of anyone, tell your people they can go fuck them- selves. He swept the ears to the floor with his arm and held the last of his wine in the air. Something for your poetry, no? he said. Some of the ears on the floor caught this scrap of his voice. Some of the ears on the floor were pressed to the ground.</p>\n"}, {"title": "War ", "view_node": "/poem/war-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/witter-bynner\" hreflang=\"und\">Witter Bynner</a>", "field_date_published": "1914", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">Fools, fools, fools, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Your blood is hot to-day. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It cools </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">When you are clay. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It joins the very clod </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wherein you look at God, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Wherein at last you see </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The living God </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The loving God, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Which was your enemy. </span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Lust Money", "view_node": "/poem/lust-money", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/lillian-yvonne-bertram\" hreflang=\"en\">Lillian-Yvonne Bertram</a>", "field_date_published": "2019", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">That slick monster sat down with us all. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A man wants to know mouth-first</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0what my face does looking at him, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if my eyes are cogitating wells</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">of sweet soup.
