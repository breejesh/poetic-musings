You know just how to move. You are determined to move just so. If I could make my image of you <em>do</em> anything, what could I imagine myself becoming? Rather than painting on canvas or sculpting in clay, I am driven to put all these ideas on myself. The artist\u2019s obsession with her subjects is all that I need to drive me to work. In Artemisia Gentileschi\u2019s painting of Cleopatra, Cleopatra reclines, heavy-lidded, left hand limp on the pillow above her head. In her right hand, she clutches an asp. Is this the moment before she is bitten or just after? I want to know whether, at the moment of death, that first release will stiffen. In <em>Dana\u00eb</em>, her reclining figure echoes Cleopatra\u2019s but Dana\u00eb\u2019s left hand is limp with leisure, not surrender, while her right holds a fistful of the gold coins raining down on her naked thighs. Looking at this painting now, I don\u2019t feel leisure. I don\u2019t feel sex. I feel that I might stiffen and not be able to rise. Dana\u00eb\u2019s legs crossed at the calves and pressing against the bed cause her back to arch so that the moment of her desire mirrors Cleopatra\u2019s death. The figure retains energy, a tension that defies either weariness or leisure. I like to work from the people that I see and that I want to see. What is fabric to skin, skin to violence? Sometimes I\u2019m concerned with using something that\u2019s in them and which isn\u2019t actually visible. I try to capture the figure where the sun has darkened the skin. But that isn\u2019t the end of the neck. In <em>Judith Slaying Holofernes</em>, the light hits Judith\u2019s neck only at the base. This space between neck and breast forms a plane of skin belted with light and I can\u2019t look away. Not the bloody knife. Not the wide eyes of Holofernes. Nothing can hold my gaze beside this neck. Artemisia has used up her patience on the neck of Judith and left nothing for the head of Holofernes. I think I use up my patience working. I use my patience looking at the skin of Judith and cannot face the dull cheek of Holofernes. Is this personal? What I increasingly feel\u2014that awful phrase \u201cspiritual grandeur\u201d\u2014I feel it like the cap of a jellyfish behind my tongue. I think a skylight must have great spiritual value. Or in Artemisia\u2019s self-portraits, what can we say about self as martyr and self as lute player? Artemisia moves her women to action and I see the painter avenging herself again and again. As I begin to make her portrait, I am conscious of the biographical. I know that I don\u2019t want the body to be read as a violated body. In each of her self-portraits, the same face swivels toward us. And as a martyr, she looks calm; as a lute-player, she suppresses a smile. Through my intimacy with the people I portray, I may have depicted aspects they find intrusive. I have worked to make her appear three-dimensional, rounded. But in this one, done by night under artificial light, the figure looks greenish, bony. A thumb peeks out from between two fingers of her left fist. She dreams. She falls backward. Cloth fills my vision. And I think I\u2019d like to bring, out of the abyss of her figure, all the illumination of arrival. The skin is teeming. The skin has such great spirit. An entire world of light is at play just under the skin. Your calves become Dana\u00eb\u2019s calves at leisure, pressed against the grey felt in pleasure, and your bare shoulders could be Judith\u2019s shoulders, broad and reflective under skylights. But as my eyes travel up, I realize you wear the wrinkled, gutted cheek of Holofernes\u2019s half-severed head. Or you wear the same dropped countenance as the one who watches you. This image denies me body in motion, your buoyant bulk; instead, it offers a still life of skin, a cap of flesh traversed by waves of color and revealing the threshold of my own body. If I can catch a glimpse of my face reflected in the facets of the paint, in the mirror of your shoulder, I feel myself lost inside the body that I see. I see myself in this naked body and begin to dress. What I like best is preparing for the party. I often change the fabric completely. Getting ready to go, arriving late, skipping the party, there\u2019s no difference really. It\u2019s only important to do the work. I\u2019m doing what I want completely. This is where I lie.</p> "}, {"title": "Helen", "view_node": "/poem/helen-1", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/mary-hickman\" hreflang=\"en\">Mary  Hickman</a>", "field_date_published": "", "body": " <p><em>Helen is of course that Helen of Sparta. Helen of Troy. Helena hated of Greece. In a dream or trance she left Troy. She finds herself in Egypt.</em> You must be patient, remembering. You can choose where. We are going to see whatever we haven\u2019t seen and maybe that means traveling down instead of across. Some say Taiwan gets better surf than China\u2019s southern beaches because it is out in the Pacific Ocean and exposed to larger swells. We camped at Bai Xia Wan. Soon Helen\u2019s skin peeled off in one snaking tube, leaving behind pink stinging surface. I lived in the south and there were always rich oil kids around. One of the great things about Taiwan, something not really true of China, is that there are a lot of small beaches where you can surf on your own. You have to watch the weather. Once, at Bai Xia, I tried to save a surfer who was drowning. I tried desperately to save him for almost twenty minutes but he didn't make it. Paradise, that idea of being together, of fusion or whatever it might look like. <em>Here there is peace. For Helena. Helena hated of all Greeks. </em>For Helen, the ocean is a way to talk about raw force. Of course, the deep sea is unknown. \u201cMore people have traveled into space than have gone down to those abyssal depths,\u201d she says. This work is work I made as we tread. While out on the coast, I kept cutting into the work, drawing over it. After living overseas for more than a decade, I had been altered in the way I had to be altered in order to enter a new lexicon, to become at once a \u201cone\u201d and \u201cnot one\u201d of local culture. Whatever happened to me, I never felt out of place, like I shouldn\u2019t be here, in this vertigo of inducing. A female traveler is a jewel-encrusted fan: Helen. She\u2019s standing on the beach but the beach has turned to scrub brush or the tide is just out and silver is beneath the water. She sheds a silver snakeskin, broken speech. We see life and call it beauty. It is magnificent, wonderful. And remembering this scene, I see fever in her face. The sheen is so plasticine it recalls salt-eaters, <em>salmon en croute</em>, inky saturation, smudges, staining. It retells our whole history, a record of perforations, <em>la parlourde</em>, <em>la morue</em>, <em>coquille St. Jacque</em>, <em>le filet de pli\u00e9</em>, and each notation we put in place so that we remember. Who are we? Who directs us? And after traveling so long together? Yes, it\u2019s this voluminous nothing that at the time is very real but later, trying to hold it still for a moment, it\u2019s then that we have reached for, or that we are straining toward, some first sight of home.</p> "}, {"title": "Eva Hesse", "view_node": "/poem/eva-hesse", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/mary-hickman\" hreflang=\"en\">Mary  Hickman</a>", "field_date_published": "", "body": " <p>I have to be strict with myself.

My attitude is most open. It is total freedom and the will to work.\u201d Eva Hesse had a stepmother named Eva Hesse who had a brain tumor two years before Eva. She got out of the hospital two years to the day Eva went in. The same hospital and same doctor. In three years, two people unrelated but with the same name? Well the story goes on. In this work, she ties the frame like a hospital bandage as if someone has broken an arm. A rigid umbilical surrounds the frame. It\u2019s composed of malleable metal. Could it expose a body? We want to know what went wrong, in the cellular, the microscopic parts, in the lipids and tissue. <em>Out of domestic reflexes my body surrounds itself. </em>But the body ultimately stays what it is: combines of organ, bone, tube. It resists all sense. This first sculpture resembles dried intestines pulled through wall. Catgut used to string instruments will last two thousand years and carry a fresher song. It\u2019s very moving, visceral of course, but restrained. As vellum\u2019s dried hide insists that there is time to consider its shape, the shape itself decays. Several of Eva\u2019s sculptures have deteriorated. They are no longer their original selves. They cannot be handled or installed as before. Consider a sculpture that, when first made, is softly draped, understated, organic, erotic, like the meninges, the protective tissue just under the skull, and is now a rigid, tawny heap. Maybe what I really want is a round table discussion about conservation. If you cut out a sizable cube of brain it retains shape, more or less. We see the pattern develop. She only had a few hours left to live. There was so much pressure. The whole brain tipped over and all the intelligence is in the front. I\u2019d like to try a material that will last. So many of Eva\u2019s raw materials are casting materials. But why think about them as casting materials? Imagine, instead, she makes the sculpture directly at the moment from each pliant or resistant shell. Although it\u2019s fragile, all Eva\u2019s work is tactile. The work has momentum. In <em>Vinculum</em>, everything is tenuous, knotted loosely, and can change. And I don\u2019t mind that, within reason. The work holds its tension even as the sculpture flexes, moves, and pours itself back into water. It is a life but of the most bizarre kind. Does it cry? Or grieve? Does it sting? Does it lie? Non-organic, but place your hand upon its hide and feel the waters riot, witness ecstatic grammars, fluent hands and a breaking, strong current and waves.</p> "}, {"title": "The Dance", "view_node": "/poem/dance-0", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/wendell-berry\" hreflang=\"und\">Wendell Berry</a>", "field_date_published": "2016", "body": " <p>I would have each couple turn,<br />join and unjoin, be lost<br />in the greater turning<br />of other couples, woven<br />in the circle of a dance,<br />the song of long time flowing</p><p>over them, so they may return,<br />turn again in to themselves<br />out of desire greater than their own,<br />belonging to all, to each,<br />to the dance, and to the song<br />that moves them through the night.</p><p>What is fidelity?

In less than a decade, the park fell onto hard times as the private wing of the mostly private public-private partnership could no longer financially sustain it. The preserve looked like it was going to have to be sold. Then the Nature Conservatory, led by a former managing director of Goldman Sachs and assisted by a $1 million dollar gift from Wichita's Koch brothers, took over. They introduced thirteen bison to the Kansas prairie to unexpected results. The bison quickly returned to their pre-Columbian population. After a controlled burn of the entire great plains in the spring of 2019, the tall grass prairie ecosystem of the U.S. restored itself from tap roots that had lain dormant at the earth\u2019s core since John Deere invented the steel plow in 1838. The interior U.S. radically depopulated as prairie dog colonies caused irreparable damage to the infrastructure of its cities and towns.</span></p> "}, {"title": "Hoarders: Tara", "view_node":
