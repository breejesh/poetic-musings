Silly things!\n      Long in the claw, but hairless; long in the ear,\n      Deaf, dumb, and blind for all purpose.\n      Brain wave too slow to eat!\n      How should poor creatures survive?\n      Watcher high above, the brood wren. . .\n      Nesting the eggs awaiting the throats young birds to sing. . .\n      Known always the sound they will be. Wings impatient to fly.\n\nCliff-martin arias. Exaltation! choired cascadings descendings sacred;\n      Canticled crystal, waterdrops diamond,\n      Trails scattered the rising wing.\n\n      Hovers the sparrow, darts at the hawk\n      Desperate protection\n      Of fierce with her terror in deadly engagement. . .\n      Small blue eggs. Calm the hawk, intently\n      Unburdened questions of unequal-matched.\n      Life lived one! all existence. . . .Small blue eggs. . . .\n\n      Consenting pause and silence: twohoots then the owl.\n      Cries the first nighthawk. Bats skirling radar new twilight.\n      A fir tree ribbons and cradles the moon. Crowned and shining.\n      Soft in the pause she lights tree mother. Down and aglow.\n      Slowly aloft on feathering finger, voyager canopied moonlight.\n      Up. And away. . . .\n\n      Great deer form, giant posed unearthly\n      Where gray fog laps the trees. . .\n      Sails slow the moss frond into the no-see. . . .\n      You are here with me, My Mother.\n\n      Departure the wood.\n      Drifts breath damp life; odor shifting vaporous.\n      The loam underfoot cooled shamrock.\n      Bethinking bobcats were hunted here. Their bounty.\n      I never saw one.\n      Fetor, however ubiquitous skunk! Never the bounty them!\n\n      Late dusk arriving the cabin. Good the day!\nPass through the gate to the highway, remains only the field to cross.\n      And last and luminous presence: propinquity to ponder. . .\n\n      Bedraggled Lily of the Roadside:\n      Trumpeter Datura Derelitta.\n      Think on it. Her blossom is so very pure. . .\n\nRank the stalk; and prickle leaf already claw gone thistle. Thorn-apple\nSpikings come no surprise. Lethal. Fell. Is witch-wood entered here!\n      Choose carefully your gait.\n\nCircumnavigate My Pretty Little Pretty! Derey me! Dearie Lictious!\n      One knows the cackle.
