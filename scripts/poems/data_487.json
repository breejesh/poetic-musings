scientists, astronauts get taller when they are in space and in Albania, nodding your head means \"no\" and shaking your head means \"yes.\" This says I am going to disappear and become a parrot, sitting on my perch in some strange woman's living room, ready to imitate everything she has to say to her illicit lover over the phone. Maybe I won't have to speak in the shrill voice of parrots, but simply nod and shake my head, getting it right, unlike the Albanians. St. Paul, Minnesota was originally called Pig's Eye after a man named Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant who set up the first business there in the mid-nineteenth century. Well, let me disappear because I live about twelve miles south of St. Paul's southern city limits and have seen the eyes of pigs quite often. Minnesota is full of them. The last one I saw was tailgating me and almost ran me off the road. Before I could switch lanes, he swerved around me and shot away. About four blocks later, he was pulled over by a cop and given a ticket. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin's mother's maiden name was \"Moon.\" That sentence is hard to say. Of course, Buzz was the second man to step onto the moon in 1969. The first was Neil Armstrong, but he had no moons in his family, so he pleaded to Buzz on his knees, \"Please, let me go second. Let me go second and every moon lover will love you forever, instead of me.\" This happened inside the capsule on its way down to the moon. Buzz thought, \"Let me disappear,\" but it was too late. They hit the surface and history was on its way. I don't have a clue what this has to do with me because the only moon in my life rose over the desert skies for the first twenty-five years of my life, until I disappeared. It is why I insist on a dark, moonless night when it is the best time for all men to go away, inspect their dreams, and maybe come back taller, wiser, and able to know the difference between yes and no.</p> "}, {"title": "In Praise of Their Divorce", "view_node": "/poem/praise-their-divorce", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/tony-hoagland\" hreflang=\"und\">Tony Hoagland</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": "<p><span class=\"long-line\">And when I heard about the divorce of my friends,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I couldn't help but be proud of them,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">that man and that woman setting off in different directions,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like pilgrims in a proverb</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\u2014him to buy his very own toaster oven, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">her seeking a prescription for sleeping pills.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Let us keep in mind the hidden forces</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">which had struggled underground for years</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">to push their way to the surface\u2014and that finally did, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">cracking the crust, moving the plates of earth apart,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">releasing the pent-up energy required</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for them to rent their own apartments,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">for her to join the softball league for single mothers</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">for him to read <em>George the Giraffe</em> over his speakerphone</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">at bedtime to the six-year-old.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The bible says, <em>Be fruitful and multiply</em></span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">but is it not also fruitful to subtract and to divide?</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Because if marriage is a kind of womb, </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">divorce is the being born again;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">alimony is the placenta one of them will eat;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">loneliness is the name of the wet-nurse;</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">regret is the elementary school;</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">endurance is the graduation.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So do not say that they are splattered like dropped lasagna</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">or dead in the head-on collision of clich\u00e9s</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or nailed on the cross of their competing narratives.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">What is taken apart is not utterly demolished.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is like a great mysterious egg in Kansas</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">that has cracked and hatched two big bewildered birds.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It is two spaceships coming out of retirement,</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">flying away from their dead world,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the burning booster rocket of divorce</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0falling off behind them, </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">the bystanders pointing at the sky and saying, <em>Look</em>.</span></p>\n"}], "pager": {"current_page": 487, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
