And then we'll sit in the shadowy spruce and pick the bones of careless mice, while the long moon drifts toward Asia and the river mutters in its icy bed.

rocks grow cold, \nAnd Philomel becometh dumb; \nThe rest complains of cares to come.\n\nThe flowers do fade, and wanton fields\nTo wayward winter reckoning yields; \nA honey tongue, a heart of gall,\nIs fancy's spring, but sorrow's fall.\n\nThy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of roses, \nThy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies\nSoon break, soon wither, soon forgotten-- \nIn folly ripe, in reason rotten.\n\nThy belt of straw and ivy buds, \nThy coral clasps and amber studs,\nAll these in me no means can move\nTo come to thee and be thy love.\n\nBut could youth last and love still breed, \nHad joys no date nor age no need,\nThen these delights my mind might move \nTo live with thee and be thy love.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love", "view_node":

sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd vines,</span><br

catches the main words only,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken to hospital,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">At present low, but will soon be better.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Ah now the single figure to me,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,</span><br />\n\u2028<span class=\"long-line\">Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,</span><br />\n\u2028<span

barefoot,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Down from the shower'd halo,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were

class=\"long-line\">And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And every day the she-bird crouch'd on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,</span><br

class=\"long-line\">Nor return'd that afternoon, nor the next, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Nor ever appear'd again.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And thenceforward all summer

sea,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Or flitting from brier to brier by day,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,</span><br /><span
