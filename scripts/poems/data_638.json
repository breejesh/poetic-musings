When you tried to help her\nGet out of the car or get from the car to the door\nOr across the apartment house hall to the elevator\nThere was a new sense of heaviness\nOr of inertia in the body. It wasn't\nThat she was less willing to be helped to walk\nBut that the walking itself had become less willing.\nMaybe the stupid demogorgon blind\nRecalcitrance of body, resentful of the laws\nOf mind and spirit, was getting its own back now,\nOr maybe a new and subtle, alien,\nIntelligence of body was obedient now\nTo other laws: \"Weight is the measure of\nThe force with which a body is drawn downward\nTo the center of the earth\"; \"Inertia is\nThe tendency of a body to resist\nProceeding to its fate in any way\nOther than that determined for itself.\"\n\nThat evening, at the Bromells' apartment, after\nShe had been carried up through the rational structure\nBy articulate stages, floor after flashing floor,\nAnd after we helped her get across the hall,\nAnd get across the room to a chair, somehow\nWe got her seated in a chair that was placed\nA little too far away from the nearest table,\nAt the edge of the abyss, and there she sat,\nExposed, her body the object of our attention--\nThe heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg,\nThe thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe.\n\nAt work between herself and us there was\nA new principle of social awkwardness\nAnd skillfulness required of each of us.\nOur tones of voice in this easy conversation\nWere instruments of marvelous finesse,\nMeasuring and maintaining with exactitude\n\"The fact or condition of the difference\nThere was between us, both in space and time.\"\n\nHer smiling made her look as if she had\nJust then tasted something delicious, the charm\nHer courtesy attributed to her friends.\n\nThis decent elegant fellow human being\nWas seated in virtue, character, disability,\nBehind her the order of the ranged bookshelves,\nThe windows monitored by Venetian blinds--\n\"These can be raised or lowered; numerous slats,\nHorizontally arranged, and parallel,\nWhich can be tilted so as to admit\nPrecisely the desired light or air.\"\n\nWe were all her friends, Maggie, and Bill, and Anne, \nAnd I, and the nice Boston Brahmin elderly man \nNamed Duncan, utterly friendly and benign.\nAnd of course it wasn't whether or not the world\nWas benign but whether it looked at her too much.\nShe wasn't \"painfully shy\" but just the same\nI wouldn't be surprised if there had been\nPainfulness in her shyness earlier on,\nSay at dancing school. Like others, though, she had\nSurvived her childhood somehow. Nor do I mean\nShe was unhappy. Maybe more or less so\nBefore her marriage. One had the sense of trips\nArranged, committees, concerts, baffled courage\nLiving it through, giving it order and style.\nAnd one had the sense of the late marriage as of\nTwo bafflements inventing the sense they made\nTogether. The marriage seemed, to the outside world,\nAnd probably was, radiant and triumphant,\nAnd I think that one could almost certainly say\nThat during the last, heroic, phase of things,\nAfter his death, and after the stroke, she had\nBy force of character and careful management,\nMaintained a certain degree of happiness.\n\nThe books there on the bookshelves told their stories,\nLine after line, all of them evenly spaced,\nAnd spaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.\nIn one of the books Dr. Johnson told the story:\n\"In the scale of being, wherever it begins,\nOr ends, there are chasms infinitely deep;\nInfinite vacuities. . .For surely,\nNothing can so disturb the passions, or\nPerplex the intellects of man so much,\nAs the disruption of this union with\nVisible nature, separation from all\nThat has delighted or engaged him, a change\nNot only of the place but of the manner\nOf his being, an entrance into a state\nNot simply which he knows not, but perhaps\nA state he has not faculties to know.\"\n\nThe dinner was delicious, fresh greens, and reds,\nAnd yellows, produce of the season due,\nAnd fish from the nearby sea; and there were also\nAshes to be eaten, and dirt to drink.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "On Looking for Models", "view_node": "/poem/looking-models", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/alan-dugan\" hreflang=\"und\">Alan Dugan</a>", "field_date_published": "1983", "body": " <pre>\nThe trees in time\nhave something else to do\nbesides their treeing.
