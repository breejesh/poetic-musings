and the more he strove\nTo advance his suit, the farther from her love.\n\nWearied at length, and wanting remedy,\nHe doubted oft, and oft resolved to die.\nBut pride stood ready to prevent the blow,\nFor who would die to gratify a foe?\nHis generous mind disdained so mean a fate;\nThat passed, his next endeavour was to hate.\nBut vainer that relief than all the rest;\nThe less he hoped, with more desire possessed;\nLove stood the siege, and would not yield his breast.\n\nChange was the next, but change deceived his care;\nHe sought a fairer, but found none so fair.\nHe would have worn her out by slow degrees,\nAs men by fasting starve the untamed disease;\nBut present love required a present ease.\nLooking, he feeds alone his famished eyes,\nFeeds lingering death, but, looking not, he dies.\nYet still he chose the longest way to fate,\nWasting at once his life and his estate.\n\nHis friends beheld, and pitied him in vain.\nFor what advice can ease a lover\u2019s pain?\nAbsence, the best expedient they could find,\nMight save the fortune, if not cure the mind:\nThis means they long proposed, but little gained,\nYet after much pursuit at length obtained.\n\nHard you may think it was to give consent,\nBut struggling with his own desires he went;\nWith large expense, and with a pompous train,\nProvided as to visit France or Spain,\nOr for some distant voyage o\u2019er the main.\nBut Love had clipped his wings, and cut him short,\nConfined within the purlieus of his court.\nThree miles he went, nor farther could retreat;\nHis travels ended at his country seat:\nTo Chassi\u2019s pleasing plains he took his way,\nThere pitched his tents, and there resolved to stay.\n\nThe spring was in the prime, the neighbouring grove\nSupplied with birds, the choristers of love;\nMusic unbought, that ministered delight\nTo morning walks, and lulled his cares by night:\nThere he discharged his friends, but not the expense\nOf frequent treats and proud magnificence.\nHe lived as kings retire, though more at large\nFrom public business, yet with equal charge;\nWith house and heart still open to receive;\nAs well content as love would give him leave:\nHe would have lived more free; but many a guest,\nWho could forsake the friend, pursued the feast.\n\nIt happed one morning, as his fancy led,\nBefore his usual hour he left his bed,\nTo walk within a lonely lawn, that stood\nOn every side surrounded by the wood:\nAlone he walked, to please his pensive mind,\nAnd sought the deepest solitude to find;\n\u2018Twas in a grove of spreading pines he strayed;\nThe winds within the quivering branches played,\nAnd dancing trees a mournful music made;\nThe place it self was suiting to his care,\nUncouth and savage as the cruel fair. \nHe wandered on, unknowing where he went,\nLost in the wood, and all on love intent:\nThe day already half his race had run,\nAnd summoned him to due repast at noon,\nBut Love could feel no hunger but his own.\n\nWhile listening to the murmuring leaves he stood,\nMore than a mile immersed within the wood,\nAt once the wind was laid; the whispering sound\nWas dumb; a rising earthquake rocked the ground;\nWith deeper brown the grove was overspread,\nA sudden horror seized his giddy head,\nAnd his ears tinkled, and his colour fled.\nNature was in alarm; some danger nigh\nSeemed threatened, though unseen to mortal eye.\nUnused to fear, he summoned all his soul,\nAnd stood collected in him self\u2014and whole; \nNot long: for soon a whirlwind rose around,\nAnd from afar he heard a screaming sound,\nAs of a dame distressed, who cried for aid,\nAnd filled with loud laments the secret shade.\n\nA thicket close beside the grove there stood,\nWith breers and brambles choked, and dwarfish wood;\nFrom thence the noise, which now approaching near\nWith more distinguished notes invades his ear;\nHe raised his head, and saw a beauteous maid\nWith hair dishevelled issuing through the shade;\nStripped of her clothes, and e\u2019en those parts revealed\nWhich modest nature keeps from sight concealed.\nHer face, her hands, her naked limbs were torn,\nWith passing through the brakes and prickly thorn;\nTwo mastiffs gaunt and grim her flight pursued,\nAnd oft their fastened fangs in blood imbrued:\nOft they came up, and pinched her tender side,\n\u201cMercy, O mercy, Heaven,\u201d she ran, and cried:\nWhen Heaven was named, they loosed their hold again.\nThen sprung she forth, they followed her amain.\n\nNot far behind, a knight of swarthy face\nHigh on a coal-black steed pursued the chace;\nWith flashing flames his ardent eyes were filled,\nAnd in his hands a naked sword he held:\nHe cheered the dogs to follow her who fled,\nAnd vowed revenge on her devoted head.\n\nAs Theodore was born of noble kind,\nThe brutal action roused his manly mind:\nMoved with unworthy usage of the maid,\nHe, though unarmed, resolved to give her aid.\nA saplin pine he wrenched from out the ground,\nThe readiest weapon that his fury found.\nThus, furnished for offence, he crossed the way\nBetwixt the graceless villain and his prey.\n\nThe knight came thundering on, but, from afar,\nThus in imperious tone forbad the war:\n\u201cCease, Theodore, to proffer vain relief,\n\u201cNor stop the vengeance of so just a grief;\n\u201cBut give me leave to seize my destined prey,\n\u201cAnd let eternal justice take the way:\n\u201cI but revenge my fate, disdained, betrayed,\n\u201cAnd suffering death for this ungrateful maid.\u201d\n\nHe said, at once dismounting from the steed;\nFor now the hell-hounds with superior speed\nHad reached the dame, and, fastening on her side,\nThe ground with issuing streams of purple dyed.\nStood Theodore surprised in deadly fright,\nWith chattering teeth, and bristling hair upright;\nYet armed with inborn worth,\u2014\u201cWhate\u2019er,\u201d said he,\n\u201cThou art, who knowst me better than I thee;\n\u201cOr prove thy rightful cause, or be defied.\u201d\nThe spectre fiercely staring, thus replied:\n\n\u201cKnow, Theodore, thy ancestry I claim,\n\u201cAnd Guido Cavalcanti was my name.\n\u201cOne common sire our fathers did beget,\n\u201cMy name and story some remember yet;\n\u201cThee, then a boy, within my arms I laid,\n\u201cWhen for my sins I loved this haughty maid;\n\u201cNot less adored in life, nor served by me,\n\u201cThan proud Honoria now is loved by thee.\n\u201cWhat did I not her stubborn heart to gain?\n\u201cBut all my vows were answered with disdain:\n\u201cShe scorned my sorrows, and despised my pain.\n\u201cLong time I dragged my days in fruitless care;\n\u201cThen loathing life, and plunged in deep despair,\n\u201cTo finish my unhappy life I fell\n\u201cOn this sharp sword, and now am damned in hell.\n\n\u201cShort was her joy; for soon the insulting maid\n\u201cBy Heaven\u2019s decree in the cold grave was laid;\n\u201cAnd as in unrepenting sin she died,\n\u201cDoomed to the same bad place, is punished for her pride:\n\u201cBecause she deemed I well deserved to die,\n\u201cAnd made a merit of her cruelty.\n\u201cThere, then, we met; both tried, and both were cast,\n\u201cAnd this irrevocable sentence passed,\n\u201cThat she, whom I so long pursued in vain,\n\u201cShould suffer from my hands a lingering pain:\n\u201cRenewed to life, that she might daily die,\n\u201cI daily doomed to follow, she to fly;\n\u201cNo more a lover, but a mortal foe,\n\u201cI seek her life (for love is none below);\n\u201cAs often as my dogs with better speed\n\u201cArrest her flight, is she to death decreed:\n\u201cThen with this fatal sword, on which I died,\n\u201cI pierce her opened back or tender side,\n\u201cAnd tear that hardened heart from out her breast,\n\u201cWhich with her entrails makes my hungry hounds a feast.\n\u201cNor lies she long, but as her fates ordain,\n\u201cSprings up to life, and fresh to second pain,\n\u201cIs saved to-day, to-morrow to be slain.\u201d\n\nThis, versed in death, the infernal knight relates,\nAnd then for proof fulfilled their common fates;\nHer heart and bowels through her back he drew,\nAnd fed the hounds that helped him to pursue. \nStern looked the fiend, as frustrate of his will,\nNot half sufficed, and greedy yet to kill.\nAnd now the soul, expiring through the wound,\nHad left the body breathless on the ground,\nWhen thus the grisly spectre spoke again:\n\u201cBehold the fruit of ill-rewarded pain!\n\u201cAs many months as I sustained her hate,\n\u201cSo many years is she condemned by Fate\n\u201cTo daily death; and every several place\n\u201cConscious of her disdain and my disgrace,\n\u201cMust witness her just punishment, and be\n\u201cA scene of triumph and revenge to me.\n\u201cAs in this grove I took my last farewell,\n\u201cAs on this very spot of earth I fell,\n\u201cAs Friday saw me die, so she my prey\n\u201cBecomes even here, on this revolving day.\u201d\n\nThus while he spoke, the virgin from the ground\nUpstarted fresh, already closed the wound,\nAnd unconcerned for all she felt before,\nPrecipitates her flight along the shore:\nThe hell-hounds, as ungorged with flesh and blood,\nPursue their prey, and seek their wonted food:\nThe fiend remounts his courser, mends his pace,\nAnd all the vision vanished from the place.\n\nLong stood the noble youth oppressed with awe\nAnd stupid at the wondrous things he saw,\nSurpassing common faith, transgressing Nature's law:\nHe would have been asleep, and wished to wake,\nBut dreams, he knew, no long impression make,\nThough strong at first; if vision, to what end,\nBut such as must his future state portend,\nHis love the damsel, and himself the fiend?\nBut yet reflecting that it could not be\nFrom Heaven, which cannot impious acts decree,\nResolved within him self to shun the snare\nWhich hell for his destruction did prepare;\nAnd as his better genius should direct,\nFrom an ill cause to draw a good effect.\n\nInspired from Heaven he homeward took his way,\nNor palled his new design with long delay;\nBut of his train a trusty servant sent\nTo call his friends together at his tent.\nThey came, and, usual salutations paid, \nWith words premeditated thus he said:\n\u201cWhat you have often counselled, to remove\n\u201cMy vain pursuit of unregarded love,\n\u201cBy thrift my sinking fortune to repair, \n\u201cThough late, yet is at last become my care:\n\u201cMy heart shall be my own; my vast expense\n\u201cReduced to bounds by timely providence:\n\u201cThis only I require; invite for me\n\u201cHonoria, with her father\u2018s family,\n\u201cHer friends and mine; the cause I shall display,\n\u201cOn Friday next, for that's the appointed day.\u201d\n\nWell pleased were all his friends, the task was light,\nThe father, mother, daughter they invite;\nHardly the dame was drawn to this repast;\nBut yet resolved, because it was the last.\nThe day was come, the guests invited came, \nAnd with the rest the inexorable dame:\nA feast prepared with riotous expense,\nMuch cost, more care, and most magnificence.\nThe place ordained was in that haunted grove\nWhere the revenging ghost pursued his love:\nThe tables in a proud pavilion spread,\nWith flowers below, and tissue overhead;\nThe rest in rank, Honoria, chief in place,\nWas artfully contrived to set her face\nTo front the thicket and behold the chace.\nThe feast was served, the time so well forecast,\nThat just when the dessert and fruits were placed,\nThe fiend\u2019s alarm began; the hollow sound\nSung in the leaves, the forest shook around,\nAir blackened, rolled the thunder, groaned the ground.\n\nNor long before the load laments arise,\nOf one distressed, and mastiffs\u2019 mingled cries;\nAnd first the dame came rushing through the wood,\nAnd next the famished hounds that sought their food,\nAnd griped her flanks, and oft essayed their jaws in blood.\nLast came the felon on the sable steed,\nArmed with his naked sword, and urged his dogs to speed.\nShe ran, and cried, her flight directly bent\n(A guest unbidden) to the fatal tent,\nThe scene of death, and place ordained for punishment.\nLoud was the noise, aghast was every guest,\nThe woman shrieked, the men forsook the feast;\nThe hounds at nearer distance hoarsely bayed;\nThe hunter close pursued the visionary maid,\nShe rent the heaven with loud laments, imploring aid.\n\nThe gallants, to protect the lady\u2019s right,\nTheir fauchions brandished at the grisly spright;\nHigh on his stirrups he provoked the fight.\nThen on the crowd he cast a furious look,\nAnd withered all their strength before he strook:\n\u201cBack on your lives! let be,\u201d said he, \u201cmy prey,\n\u201cAnd let my vengeance take the destined way:\n\u201cVain are your arms, and vainer your defence,\n\u201cAgainst the eternal doom of Providence:\n\u201cMine is the ungrateful maid by Heaven designed:\n\u201cMercy she would not give, nor mercy shall she find.\u201d\nAt this the former tale again he told \nWith thundering tone, and dreadful to behold:\nSunk were their hearts with horror of the crime,\nNor needed to be warned a second time,\nBut bore each other back; some knew the face,\nAnd all had heard the much lamented case\nOf him who fell for love, and this the fatal place.\n\nAnd now the infernal minister advanced,\nSeized the due victim, and with fury lanced \nHer back, and piercing through her inmost heart,\nDrew backward as before the offending part.\nThe recking entrails next he tore away,\nAnd to his meagre mastiffs made a prey.\nThe pale assistants on each other stared,\nWith gaping mouths for issuing words prepared;\nThe stillborn sounds upon the palate hung,\nAnd died imperfect on the faltering tongue. \nThe fright was general; but the female band,\nA helpless train, in more confusion stand:\nWith horror shuddering, on a heap they run,\nSick at the sight of hateful justice done;\nFor conscience rung the alarm, and made the case their own.\n\nSo spread upon a lake, with upward eye,\nA plump of fowl behold their foe on high;\nThey close their trembling troop; and all attend\nOn whom the sowsing eagle will descend.\n\nBut most the proud Honoria feared the event,\nAnd thought to her alone the vision sent.\nHer guilt presents to her distracted mind\nHeaven's justice, Theodore\u2019s revengeful kind,\nAnd the same fate to the same sin assigned;\nAlready sees her self the monster's prey,\nAnd feels her heart and entrails torn away.\n\u2018Twas a mute scene of sorrow, mixed with fear;\nStill on the table lay the unfinished cheer:\nThe knight and hungry mastiffs stood around,\nThe mangled dame lay breathless on the ground;\nWhen on a sudden, re-inspired with breath,\nAgain she rose, again to suffer death;\nNor stayed the hell-hounds, nor the hunter stayed,\nBut followed, as before, the flying maid:\nThe avenger took from earth the avenging sword,\nAnd mounting light as air his sable steed he spurred:\nThe clouds dispelled, the sky resumed her light,\nAnd Nature stood recovered of her fright.\n\nBut fear, the last of ills, remained behind,\nAnd horror heavy sat on every mind.\nNor Theodore encouraged more his feast,\nBut sternly looked, as hatching in his breast\nSome deep design, which when Honoria viewed \nThe fresh impulse her former fright renewed:\nShe thought her self the trembling dame who fled,\nAnd him the grisly ghost that spurred the infernal steed:\nThe more dismayed, for when the guests withdrew,\nTheir courteous host saluting all the crew,\nRegardless passed her o\u2019er, nor graced with kind adieu.\nThat sting infixed within her haughty mind,\nThe downfall of her empire she divined;\nAnd her proud heart with secret sorrow pined.\nHome as they went, the sad discourse renewed,\nOf the relentless dame to death pursued,\nAnd of the sight obscene so lately viewed;\nNone durst arraign the righteous doom she bore,\nEven they who pitied most yet blamed her more:\nThe parallel they needed not to name,\nBut in the dead they damned the living dame.\n\nAt every little noise she looked behind,\nFor still the knight was present to her mind:\nAnd anxious oft she started on the way,\nAnd thought the horseman-ghost came thundering for his prey.\nReturned, she took her bed with little rest,\nBut in short slumbers dreamt the funeral feast;\nAwaked, she turned her side, and slept again;\nThe same black vapours mounted in her brain,\nAnd the same dreams returned with double pain.\n\nNow forced to wake, because afraid to sleep, \nHer blood all fevered, with a furious leap\nShe sprung from bed, distracted in her mind,\nAnd feared, at every step, a twitching spright behind.\nDarkling and desperate, with a staggering pace,\nOf death afraid, and conscious of disgrace,\nFear, pride, remorse, at once her heart assailed;\nPride put remorse to flight, but fear prevailed.\nFriday, the fatal day, when next it came,\nHer soul forethought the fiend would change his game,\nAnd her pursue, or Theodore be slain,\nAnd two ghosts join their packs to hunt her o\u2019er the plain.\n\nThis dreadful image so possessed her mind,\nThat, desperate any succour else to find,\nShe ceased all farther hope; and now began\nTo make reflection on the unhappy man.\nRich, brave, and young, who past expression loved,\nProof to disdain, and not to be removed:\nOf all the men respected and admired,\nOf all the dames, except her self, desired:\nWhy not of her? preferred above the rest\nBy him with knightly deeds, and open love professed?\nSo had another been, where he his vows addressed.\nThis quelled her pride, yet other doubts remained,\nThat once disdaining, she might be disdained.\nThe fear was just, but greater fear prevailed,\nFear of her life by hellish hounds assailed:\nHe took a lowering leave; but who can tell\nWhat outward hate might inward love conceal?\nHer sex\u2019s arts she knew, and why not then\nMight deep dissembling have a place in men?\nHere hope began to dawn; resolved to try,\nShe fixed on this her utmost remedy;\nDeath was behind, but hard it was to die:\n\u2018Twas time enough at last on death to call;\nThe precipice in sight, a shrub was all\nThat kindly stood betwixt to break the fatal fall.\n\nOne maid she had, beloved above the rest:\nSecure of her, the secret she confessed;\nAnd now the cheerful light her fears dispelled,\nShe with no winding turns the truth concealed,\nBut put the woman off, and stood revealed:\nWith faults confessed, commissioned her to go,\nIf pity yet had place, and reconcile her foe.\nThe welcome message made was soon received;\n\u2018Twas what he wished and hoped, but scarce believed:\nFate seemed a fair occasion to present,\nHe knew the sex, and feared she might repent\nShould he delay the moment of consent.\nThere yet remained to gain her friends (a care\nThe modesty of maidens well might spare);\nBut she with such a zeal the cause embraced,\n(As women, where they will, are all in haste,)\nThe father, mother, and the kin beside,\nWere overborne by fury of the tide;\nWith full consent of all she changed her state;\nResistless in her love, as in her hate.\n\nBy her example warned, the rest beware;\nMore easy, less imperious, were the fair;\nAnd that one hunting, which the devil designed\nFor one fair female, lost him half the kind.</pre>\n"}, {"title": "Heroic Stanzas on the Death of Oliver Cromwell", "view_node": "/poem/heroic-stanzas-death-oliver-cromwell", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/john-dryden\" hreflang=\"und\">John Dryden</a>", "field_date_published": "1658", "body": " <pre>\n<i>Written after his funeral</i>.\n\nAnd now 'tis time;
