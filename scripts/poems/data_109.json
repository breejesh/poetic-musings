the most dangerous weapon</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">in America is the voice of a black woman</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And it shows that black lives do in matter</span><br

Anybody in love? All the people that\u2019s like forget like, I ain\u2019t never want love, I ain\u2019t gonna have love? Ok. Anybody have a boo, cuddle buddy, bae, whatever ya\u2019ll call em these days. Snuggle bunny. So, so kinda like the second part to that poem, so like growing up as a man, well as people in general, but especially as a man I felt like love was kinda like a game right?</em>\u201d</p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So When I was a kid I had this great fascination with sports.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From soccer to football to tennis</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I played any game that involved a ball and a competition I could win.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Favorite sport of all time was basketball.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I wanted to be like MJ and play in the NBA.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So everyday after school I would practice layups, jumpers and triple threat stance</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Until the street lights came on.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Hoping that one day I would make it to the league.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">If you haven\u2019t figured it out by now,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That career ain\u2019t quite work out for me.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now I work here and write poems.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But I was always a fan of any game I put my heart</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Mind, body and soul completely into.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Except when it came to the game of love.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">See when it came to the game of love</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I was more like a rookie.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A benchwarmer trying to fight my way</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">into the starting lineup.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I was never on the first string.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Never picked up on the first run,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So I had to sit on the sidelines and watch</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Other players score when I was struggling to get a shot.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">I had to find out very quickly</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">That some women will always put you on their roster,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But would rather choose men with less skills</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And more swag.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">More J\u2019s than A\u2019s.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">More willing to run and shoot than to throw you an assist.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Obsessed with tight ends who only wanted</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To touchdown between your legs.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Mark your private parts on their scoresheet</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Rank you on their ESPN top lays of the week</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And then when they traded you for a new pick,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You always came running back to us.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">See relationships are alot like sports.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Everyone wants to play but no one shows up to practice.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Put in the hard work on the hardwood,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Grind for glory on the gridiron.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fight on the ice.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Go the distance for 12 rounds \u2018cause this is more than just a game</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">From the first kiss to the first fight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You will find yourself in nonstop action.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">Your first date is a scrimmage,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Where both sides are feeling each other out</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Trying to determine if you are worthy of playing time.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Your argument is a heavyweight fight</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Full of low blows and sucker punches</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Jabs and uppercuts designed to KO your opponent.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The first time you show your physical love</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Will probably be after that first argument.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">And if it ya\u2019ll make sure it feels like the olympics.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Make her long jump from long strokes.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Turn his baton in a pole vault.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Turn a javelin into a discus until it shotputs</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And then when you are done remember to never</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Make them jump over hurdles for your affection.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Treat them like your star player.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The only option in your triple threat offense.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cause if you don\u2019t, there will always</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">be players on the sidelines waiting to get drafted.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Fans in the stands</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Looking for you to drop the ball so they can pick up your fumbles</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So if you want them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Then show how them that you want them</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Put down your guards and power forward</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">By making them the center of your attention.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Treat them like your teammate and not your sparring partner.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2018Cause relationships don\u2019t come with playbooks.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">No sets and schemes to beat the opposing team.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">You have to play as you go, work out</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Put in the overtime hoping that you can win the game</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But remember ya\u2019ll this is more than just a game,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It\u2019s an experience.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">See in the game of tennis, when a player has yet to score a point</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In a match it is called \u201clove\u201d.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cause they know it's not about keeping score.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">It's about starting with nothing and adding more on top</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">To build something beautiful.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And ya\u2019ll love is beautiful.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Love is the only competition worth living and dying for</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">So we run suicides</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Cause sometimes you have to kill the person you are</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">In order to birth the lover you\u2019re meant to become.</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">So, no I am not in the NBA.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I will never get drafted to play in the major leagues.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">But every time I look at the scoreboards in her eyes I</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">know there is no way in the world</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I could possibly ever lose.</span></p>\n"}, {"title": "Black Womxn Version II", "view_node":

I bring out the trumpets and horns whenever I need to shake this crypt dust settling my bones. I turn my stereo up. Just the other day, so-and-so tells me he wants me to teach \u2018im the moves.

The codes an impenetrable thing; how the slide is sauve, how the count off for the take off is the dip low, the count out. The down swing recollects our plot of land on this earth. Picking a leg high, a knee raised, a turn to the left is the way we know to leave our massacre behind, man. The dance floor is a square padlock you can't crack. Each space we take there is meant for us to occupy. Each brethren is attached to our side, our fronts, our backs. This pattern is a shield against depression or hunger hanging out of someone's blue eyes. Our bodies arrange a constellation in memory of the boy who was slain with no indictment, for the guillotined girl who went forgotten, for the housing stacked like the gut of the ship, the dogs and the waters. The blast off happens insync and our spirits rupture ceilings. We ritual. Sacred. Secret. Originators of a beat cascading. The electric slide is how we leave here, how we ascend.
