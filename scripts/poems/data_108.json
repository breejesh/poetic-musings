some process at least where you can file a grievance\u00a0<br />\nwhen you grieve someone that you love\u2026\u2028Hey, wait a minute, can I file a grievance on self?\u2028can I tell the judge that I was the one stealing my own spiritual wealth? \u2028Can I really file a grievance on me? \u2028If I could, it would go a little something like this\u2026 \u2028\u201cyour honor, I have failed to give honor to this your queen, your honor.\u201d \u2028\u201cI have treated her poorly and tried to intoxicate\u00a0<br />\nover some of the things that harmed her, your honor.\u2028She\u2019s tried to ignore some of the things that she\u2019s seen and not seen your honor!\u201d\u2028Since I\u2019m talking about self, I\u2019m not suggesting that you throw the book, but I\u2019m speaking on her behalf and finally she\u2019s taking a real thorough look. \u2028She\u2019s tired, don\u2019t want to fight no more, don\u2019t want to make herself last.\u2028Can\u2019t love self while looking at a hated past. \u2028She\u2019s tried to fuel it with food and tried to fuel it with a fool,\u2028even her own punishment was unusual and cruel.\u2028\u201cYour honor, this might be a little nontraditional,\u00a0<br />\nbut is mandatory to my destiny that I complete this ritual, \u2028see I\u2019m arresting myself, see I\u2019m arresting me, \u2028because I\u2019m already connected with the jailer,<br />\n\u00a0but He made me free, that means that I hold the key! \u2028\u201cYour honor, this queen is guilty of not loving me, your honor, see this queen is guilty of not giving this queen honor\u2026. your honor!\u201d \u2028So my deposition needs to go a little something like this ... the self-hate and destiny can\u2019t coexist\u2028I\u2019m in some type of spiritual warfare and I\u2019m the one struggling to exist, \u2028will gladly enlist \u2028the one who did persist \u2028joining the enemy\u2018s lines,\u2028but its finally way beyond time. \u2028There will be no queen left behind! \u2028\u201cYeah, I know she\u2019s guilty as charged of the spiritual disregard \u2028the reckless dishonor, of God\u2019s chosen daughter that she purposely dishonors.\u201d \u2028and since I\u2019ve come this far, I guess it\u2019s time for me to finally Get honest\u2028Letting go of the victim mentality and getting some real peace and solace \u2028It\u2019s time to really get into creation and demolish your honor \u2028in case it\u2019s any question of my guilt, I\u2019d like to submit into evidence...\u2028\u201cExhibit A\u201d- I have the power but in trouble did not fast and would not pray.\u2028\u201cExhibit B\u201d- She went days with no food, worry, no sleep,\u2028\u201cExhibit C\u201d- Dated an abuser with no capacity to love me \u2028\u201cExhibit D\u201d- Dined with depression and made a cozy pallet within me \u2028\u201cExhibit E\u201d- Days she didn\u2019t eat, body thinking it was starving me \u2028\u201cExhibit F\u201d- Introvert, putting

rest this case, I\u2019m asking you to please arrest this case,<br />\n\u00a0and arrest this very place, because there\u2019s no present and there is no past\u00a0<br />\nbecause there\u2019s no
