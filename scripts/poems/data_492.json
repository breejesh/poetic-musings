Out of town?\nIn my pajamas, I sat at my father's feet\nin front of their squat, myopic television, \nthe first in our neighborhood.\n\nOn a screen the size of a salad plate,\ntoy airplanes droned over quilted fields.\nBouquets of jellyfish fell: parachutes abloom,\ngray toy soldiers drifting together, drifting apart\u2014 \n\nthe way families do, but I didn't know that yet. \nI was six or seven. The tv was an aquarium: \nsteely fish fell from the belly of a plane, \nthen burst into flame when they hit bottom. \n\nA dollhouse surrendered a wall, the way such houses do. \nFurniture hung onto wallpaper for dear life. \nDown in the crumble of what had been a street, \nwomen tore brick from brick, filling a baby carriage. \n\n\n<b>II</b>\n\nWhat was my young father, \njust a few years back from that war, \nlooking for? The farm boy from Nebraska\nhe'd been before he'd seen Dachau? \n\nNext door, my brother and sister fought\nthe Battle of Bedtime, bath by bath. \nNext door, in the living room,\na two-tone cowboy lay where he fell,\ntoo bowlegged to stand. Where was his horse?\nAnd the Indian who'd come apart at the waist\u2014\nwhere were his legs to be found? \nA fireman, licorice-red from helmet to boot, \n\na coil of white rope slung over his arm \nlike a mint Lifesaver, tried to help. \nA few inches of ladder crawled under a cushion, \nlooking for crumbs. Between the sag of couch \n\nand the slump of rocker, past a pickle-green soldier, \na plastic foxhole, cocoa brown, dug itself\ninto the rug of no man's land \nand waited to trip my mother. \n\n\n<b>III</b>\n\nAm I the oldest one here? In the theater, \nthe air of expectation soured by mouse and mold\u2014 \nin the dark, a constellation of postage stamps:\nthe screens of cell phones glow.\n\nAnd then we were in Algiers, we were in Marseille. \nOn foot, we fell in behind a ragged file \nof North African infantry. Farther north \nthan they'd ever been, we trudged\n\nstraight into the arms of the enemy: \nwinter, 1944. Why did the French want to live in France, \nthe youngest wondered while they hid, \nwaiting capture by the cold. \n\nThey relieved a dead German soldier\nof greatcoat and boots. Village by muddy village,\nthey stole, shadow to shadow, trying to last \nuntil the Americans arrived\u2014 \n\nas if, just out of range of the lens,\nthe open trucks of my father's unit \nwould rumble over the rutted horizon.\nGood with a rifle, a farsighted farm boy\n\nmade company clerk because he'd learned to type\nin high school\u2014how young he would look, \nnot half my age, and no one to tell him\nhe'll survive those months in Europe,\n\nhe'll be spared the Pacific by Hiroshima.\nFifty years from then, one evening, \nfrom the drawer where he kept \nthe tv remote, next to his flint-knapping tools, \n\nhe'd take out a small gray notebook \nand show his eldest daughter \nhow, in pencil, in tiny hurried script,\nhe kept the names of those who died around him.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "My Father", "view_node": "/poem/my-father", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/scott-hightower\" hreflang=\"und\">Scott Hightower</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>\nwas a cowboy.\nMy father was a sugar man.\nMy father was a teamster.\n \nMy father was a Siberian \ntiger; a corsair; a lamb, \na yellow dog, a horse's ass.\n \nMy father had a triple bi-pass.\nMy father was a rat \nbut he bought me my first hat. \n \nMy father believed in decency \nand fair play.

Smoke coursed into the courtyard,\nand we wrought hunger upon\nthe bodies of strangers. I am sure you\ncan imagine\nit, really what need \nis there for me to tell you.\nYou were a stranger once too, and I\nbrought rope.\n\n\nVI.\n\nAfterward, I \nslept,\nand let the dealers \ncome to me alone \nwith their jewels and \ntheir powders.\n\n\nVII.\n\nAt night, we debated\nthe skin of language,\nquestioned what might\nbe revealed inside:\na soft pink fruit,\na woman in a field\u2026\nOr a shadow, sticky and loose\nas old jam. Our own \ndialect was abstract,\nwe wished to understand\nnot how things were\nbut what spectacle we might \nmake from them.\n\n\nVIII.\n\nOne day a merchant came to court \nand brought moving pictures, \nthe emperor\u2019s new delight. \nHe tacked dark cloth \nto the windows and turned off\nthe lights, cranking the machine and the film\nlike a needle and thread,\nmaking stories we could \ninsinuate our cold bodies\ninto and find warmth. Light;\ndark. And the sliding images of courtiers\nmerrily balancing monkeys\non their heads, as if this \nwere an adequate story.\n\n\nIX.\n\nAnd our queen, that hidden\nself. What became\nof her? Slid into the night\nlike a statue, shivered\ninto shadows. Knowing as a spider\nin retreat. The web\nher mind, and in it, the fly.\n\n\nX.\n\nOn Sundays, we flew kites \nto ensure our joy\nwas seen by those who \nthreatened\nto threaten us. The thread\nspooling out high \nin the purple sky\nand silver-gelatin films being made,\nsliding through the cranking machine\nso that the barbarians could know\nwe made images of ourselves\ncoated in precious metal\nand sent them away\nindifferent to our wealth.\n\nI miss the citrus \nsmell of spring\non the plaza filled\nwith young\nand long-limbed kite flyers.\n\n\nXI.\n\nDo I have anything \nto add? Only that\nI obeyed my king, my\nkind, I was not faithless.\nShould I be punished\nfor that? It is true \nthe pictures creaking \nthrough the spindle\ncause me pain. I know \nthe powder we coated our fingers\nwith made us thirsty\nand sometimes cruel. But I was born\nwith a spirit, like you.\nI have woken, you see,\nand I wish to be made new.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Ophelia to the Court", "view_node": "/poem/ophelia-court", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/meghan-orourke\" hreflang=\"und\">Meghan O&#039;Rourke</a>", "field_date_published": "2010", "body": " <pre>\nMy shoes are unpolished, my words smudged.\nI come to you undressed (the lord, he whispers\nSmut; that man, he whispers such).
