that is, you know this ending is a deception\nbecause of course nature is always renewing itself\u2014\n        the trees don't <i>die</i>, they just pretend,\n        go out in style, and return in style: a new style.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        2 \n\nIs it deliberate how far they make you go\nespecially if you live in the city to get far \nenough away from home to see not just trees \nbut only trees? The boring highways, roadsigns, high \nspeeds, 10-axle trucks passing you as if they were \nin an even greater hurry than you to look at leaves:\nso you drive in terror for literal hours and it looks \nlike rain, or <i>snow</i>, but it's probably just clouds\n(too cloudy to see any color?) and you wonder, \ngiven the poverty of your memory, which road had the \nmost color last year, but it doesn't matter since \nyou're probably too late anyway, or too early\u2014\n        whichever road you take will be the wrong one\n        and you've probably come all this way for nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        3 \n\nYou'll be driving along depressed when suddenly\na cloud will move and the sun will muscle through\nand ignite the hills.

Flame and rust. Flame and rust, the permutations\nof burning. You're on fire. Your eyes are on fire.\nIt won't last, you don't want it to last. You \ncan't stand any more. But you don't want it to stop. \nIt's what you've come for. It's what you'll\ncome back for. It won't stay with you, but you'll \n        remember that it felt like nothing else you've felt\n        or something you've felt that also didn't last.</pre>\n "}, {"title": "Six Words", "view_node": "/poem/six-words", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/lloyd-schwartz\" hreflang=\"und\">Lloyd Schwartz</a>", "field_date_published": "2003", "body": " <pre>&#13;\n<i>yes\t&#13;\nno&#13;\nmaybe&#13;\nsometimes&#13;\nalways&#13;\nnever</i>&#13;\n&#13;\nNever?&#13;\n<i>Yes.</i>&#13;\nAlways?&#13;\n<i>No.</i>&#13;\nSometimes?&#13;\n<i>Maybe\u2014&#13;\n&#13;\nmaybe &#13;\nnever&#13;\nsometimes.</i>&#13;\nYes\u2014&#13;\nno&#13;\nalways:&#13;\n&#13;\nalways&#13;\nmaybe.&#13;\n<i>No\u2014&#13;\nnever&#13;\nyes.</i>&#13;\nSometimes,&#13;\n&#13;\nsometimes&#13;\n(always)&#13;\nyes.&#13;\n<i>Maybe&#13;\nnever . . .</i>&#13;\nNo,\t&#13;\n&#13;\nno\u2014&#13;\nsometimes.&#13;\n<i>Never.</i>&#13;\nAlways?&#13;\n<i>Maybe.</i>&#13;\nYes\u2014&#13;\n&#13;\nyes no&#13;\nmaybe sometimes&#13;\nalways never.</pre>&#13;\n "}, {"title": "An American in Hollywood (audio only)", "view_node": "/poem/american-hollywood-audio-only", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/frank-bidart\" hreflang=\"und\">Frank Bidart</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <p>\u00a0</p><p>Click the icon above to listen to this audio poem.</p> "}, {"title": "Embodies", "view_node": "/poem/embodies", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/jorie-graham\" hreflang=\"und\">Jorie Graham</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <pre>\nDeep autumn &amp;

Two panicked children strain against the gelatin envelope of the township, producing, through distension, a frightening shape. The animals see an opaque, milky membrane bulging with life and retreat, as you would, to the inner world. I am speaking for you in January. It is raining.

On its strains\nHis spirit must have nightly floated free,\nThough still about his hands he felt his chains.\nWho heard great \"Jordan roll\"? Whose starward eye\nSaw chariot \"swing low\"? And who was he\nThat breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,\n\"Nobody knows de trouble I see\"? \n  \nWhat merely living clod, what captive thing,\nCould up toward God through all its darkness grope,\nAnd find within its deadened heart to sing\nThese songs of sorrow, love and faith, and hope?\nHow did it catch that subtle undertone,\nThat note in music heard not with the ears?\nHow sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,\nWhich stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears. \n  \nNot that great German master in his dream\nOf harmonies that thundered amongst the stars\nAt the creation, ever heard a theme\nNobler than \"Go down, Moses.\" Mark its bars\nHow like a mighty trumpet-call they stir\nThe blood. Such are the notes that men have sung\nGoing to valorous deeds; such tones there were\nThat helped make history when Time was young. \n  \nThere is a wide, wide wonder in it all,\nThat from degraded rest and servile toil\nThe fiery spirit of the seer should call\nThese simple children of the sun and soil.\nO black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,\nYou\u2014you alone, of all the long, long line\nOf those who've sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,\nHave stretched out upward, seeking the divine. \n  \nYou sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;\nNo chant of bloody war, no exulting pean\nOf arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings\nYou touched in chord with music empyrean.\nYou sang far better than you knew; the songs\nThat for your listeners' hungry hearts sufficed\nStill live,\u2014but more than this to you belongs:\nYou sang a race from wood and stone to Christ. \n</pre>\n"}, {"title": "The Starlings (audio only)", "view_node": "/poem/starlings-audio-only", "field_author": "<a href=\"/poet/afaa-michael-weaver\" hreflang=\"und\">Afaa Michael Weaver</a>", "field_date_published": "2008", "body": " <p>\u00a0</p><p>Click the icon above to listen to this audio poem.</p> "}], "pager": {"current_page": 536, "total_items": "13248", "total_pages": 663, "items_per_page": 20}}
