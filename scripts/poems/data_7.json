Here and there</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">his brown skin hung in strips</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">like ancient wallpaper,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and its pattern of darker brown</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">was like wallpaper:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">shapes like full-blown roses</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">stained and lost through age.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">He was speckled with barnacles,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">fine rosettes of lime,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and infested</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with tiny white sea-lice,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and underneath two or three</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">rags of green weed hung

peony.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I looked into his eyes</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">which were far larger than mine</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">but shallower, and yellowed,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the irises backed and packed</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with tarnished tinfoil</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">seen through the lenses</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of old scratched isinglass.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">They shifted a little, but not</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to return my stare.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2014It was more like the tipping</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">of an object toward the light.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I admired his sullen face,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the mechanism of his jaw,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and then I saw</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">that from his lower lip</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u2014if you could call it a lip\u2014</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">grim, wet, and weaponlike,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">hung five old pieces of fish-line,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">or four and a wire leader</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with the swivel still attached,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">with all their five big hooks</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">grown firmly in his mouth.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">A green line, frayed at the end</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">where he broke it, two heavier lines,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and a fine black thread</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">still crimped from the strain and snap</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">when it broke and he got away.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Like medals with their ribbons</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">frayed and wavering,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">a five-haired beard of wisdom</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">trailing from his aching jaw.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I stared and stared</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">and victory filled up</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the little rented boat,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">from the pool of bilge</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">where oil had spread a rainbow</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">around the rusted engine</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">to the bailer rusted orange,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the sun-cracked thwarts,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the oarlocks on their strings,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">the gunnels\u2014until

Weston's book on the Grail legend: <em>From Ritual to Romance</em> (Macmillan). Indeed, so deeply am I indebted, Miss Weston's book will elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do; and I recommend it (apart from the great interest of the book itself) to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble. To another work of anthropology I am indebted in general, one which has influenced our generation profoundly; I mean <em>The Golden Bough</em>; I have used especially the two volumes <em>Adonis, Attis, Osiris</em>. Anyone who is acquainted with these works will immediately recognise in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies.</span></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><span class=\"long-line\">I.

class=\"long-line\">\"A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Along the briny beach: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">We cannot do with more than four, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To give a hand to each.\" </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The eldest Oyster looked at him,</span><br /><span

</span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">But four young Oysters hurried up,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All eager for the treat: </span><br /><span

followed them,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet another four; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And thick and fast they came at last, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And more and more and more\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">All hopping through the frothy waves, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And scrambling to the shore. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">The Walrus and the Carpenter </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Walked on a mile or so, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And then they rested on a rock </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conveniently low: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And all the little Oysters stood </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And waited in a row. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\"The time has come,\" the Walrus said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To talk of many things:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Of shoes\u2014and ships\u2014and sealing-wax\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of cabbages\u2014and kings\u2014 </span><br /><span

a bit,\" the Oysters cried, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Before we have our chat; </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">For some of us are out of breath,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And all of us are fat!\" </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"No hurry!\" said the Carpenter. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They thanked him much for that. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\"A loaf of bread,\" the Walrus said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Is what we chiefly need: </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Pepper and vinegar besides </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Are very good indeed\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We can begin to feed.\" </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\"But not on us!\" the Oysters cried, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning a little blue.</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"After such kindness, that would be </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A dismal thing to do!\" </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\"The night is fine,\" the Walrus said, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you admire the view? </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\"It was so kind of you to come!</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And you are very nice!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Carpenter said nothing but </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Cut us another slice. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">I wish you were not quite so deaf\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I've had to ask you twice!\" </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\"It seems a shame,\" the Walrus said,</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To play them such a trick. </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">After we've brought them out so far, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And made them trot so quick!\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">The Carpenter said nothing but </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The butter's spread too thick!\" </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\"I weep for you,\" the Walrus said:</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I deeply sympathize.\" </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">With sobs and tears he sorted out </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those of the largest size, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Holding his pocket-handkerchief </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before his streaming eyes. </span></p>\n\n<p><span class=\"long-line\">\"0 Oysters,\" said the Carpenter, </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You've had a pleasant run! </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">Shall we be trotting home again?\"</span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But answer came there none\u2014 </span><br /><span class=\"long-line\">And this was scarcely odd, because </span><br /><span
