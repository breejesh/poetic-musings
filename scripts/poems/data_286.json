So much</div><div>happens after harvest: the moon</div><div>performing novelty: slaughter,</div><div>snow. One hour the same</div><div>as the next, I held my hands</div><div>or held the snow. I was like sculpture,</div><div>forgetting or, perhaps, remembering</div><div>everything. Red wings in the snow,</div><div>red thoughts ablaze in the war</div><div>I was having with myself again.</div><div>Everything I hate about the world</div><div>I hate about myself, even now</div><div>writing as if this were a law</div><div>of nature.

Say</div><div>I was not the only one who saw</div><div>or heard the trees, their diffidence</div><div>greater than my noise. Perhaps</div><div>the future is a tiny flame</div><div>I\u2019ll nick from a candle. First, I\u2019m burning.</div><div>Then, numb.
